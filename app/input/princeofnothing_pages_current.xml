            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">[[Project:Administrators|Administrators]] can '''protect''' and '''unprotect''' pages, including ones that do not exist. Protection of a page or image usually means that a non-admin cannot modify it.

The majority of pages on all Wikia should remain publicly editable, and '''not protected'''. Pages may, however, be temporarily or permanently protected for legal reasons (for example, license texts should not be changed) or in cases of extreme vandalism or edit warring or abusive re-creation.

==Uses==

*Protecting highly vandalised pages, such as the [[Main Page]] on large wikis.
*Maintaining the integrity of the site's logo and favicon.
*Maintaining the integrity of key [[Project:copyrights|copyright]] and license pages.
*Preventing repeatedly created vandal or spam pages from creation. See [[Special:Protectedtitles]]
*Protecting the interface and system messages in the MediaWiki namespace (these are protected automatically)

A '''temporary''' protection is used for:
*Enforcing a "cool down" period to stop an "edit war", upon request.
*Protecting a page or image that has been a recent target of ''persistent'' vandalism or ''persistent'' edits by a banned user.

There is no need to protect personal .css and .js pages like user/monobook.css or user/cologneblue.js. Only the accounts associated with these pages (and admins) are able to edit them. (For more information on using these pages, see the [[Wikia:Help:User style|help page on Central]]

== Usage ==

Most pages and images are unprotected by default, only the site logo and favicons are automatically protected. You can protect editing, moving, or both by checking or unchecking the '''Unlock move permissions selection box'''.

*'''(default)''' means any user, whether logged in or anonymous, can edit or move the page.
*'''Block unregistered users''', or semi-protected, means anonymous users and new accounts less than 4 days old cannot edit and/or move pages.
*'''Sysops only''', or fully-protected, means only administrators may edit and/or move the page.

Pages can also be cascade protected, this will cause all images, pages, or templates transcluded onto the page to be fully protected, even if the main article is only semi-protected.

==Rules==
#Do not make the common mistake of protecting pages unnecessarily. For example, do not protect a page simply because it is the Main Page.
#Do not [[Help:Editing|edit]] a temporarily protected page except to add a notice explaining the page is protected.
#Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over. Admin powers are not editor privileges - admins should only act as servants to the user community at large.
#Avoid favoring one version of the article over another, unless one version is vandalism.
#Temporarily protected pages should not be left protected for very long.
#Talk pages and user talk pages are not protected except in extreme circumstances.
#The protection of a page on any particular version is not meant to express support for that version and requests should therefore not be made that the protected version be reverted to a different one.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3430">Different users have access to different functions of the site. While anyone can do most things on the site, including reading and editing, '''administrators''' can access a few additional functions.

== Administrator abilities ==
These additional functions include:
* Deleting and undeleting pages, page histories, and uploaded files.
* Locking ([[{{ns:project}}:Protected page|protecting]]) a page so it cannot be edited or renamed by users without admin rights or autoconfirmed status.
* Blocking IP addresses or user names from editing; and very quick "rollback" of undesirable edits.
* Editing the interface by changing system messages and skins.

== Bureaucrat abilities ==

A '''bureaucrat''' can make other users into bureaucrats or administrators on their own wiki. However, they are not currently able to remove admin access from any user; please contact one of the [[w:Community Team|community team]] if you need that done.

Bureaucrats can also give users the ability to "rollback" edits not made in [[w:Assume good faith|good faith]].

== Staff and Janitors ==

Some Wikia staff members have full access to all Wikia. They will be shown in [[Special:Listusers/staff]] on any wiki. [[Wikia:Janitor policy and guidelines|Wikia janitors]] have limited administrator access to all Wikia for cleanup purposes. These users will be shown on [[Special:Listusers/janitor]] on any Wikia. Please see the Central Wikia [[Wikia:Contact us|contact page]] for details on how to contact Wikia staff.

== Who are this wiki's administrators? ==

The "founder" of a wiki, the person who first requested it, is given administrator access automatically. Founders are also given bureaucrat access so they can make any other user on their wiki an administrator or bureaucrat. For a complete list of users with administrator access, see [[Special:Listusers/sysop]].

You may also wish to list them on this page.

*[[User:Neorem]]
*[[User:Bogobor]]
*[[User:Serwë]]

== How do I use administrator powers? ==

See the [[Help:Administrators' how-to guide|administrators' how-to guide]] for a guide on using admin functions.

== Becoming an administrator ==

For you to become an administrator, someone with bureaucrat access must make you one. On larger Wikia, there will usually be a community page for requests. On a smaller wiki, you may simply ask on the community portal or ask a bureaucrat directly on his or her talk page.

If there are no active bureaucrats and you wish to become an administrator or adopt the wiki, please contact the [[Wikia:Community Team|community staff on the Central Wikia.]]. If there are other active editors but no active bureaucrats/admins, you should first discuss with them on who should become an admin, whether it be one of you, or all of you.

== What can administrators not do? ==

Administrators should not use their administrator powers to settle editing disputes; for example, to lock a page on a version he or she prefers in an editing dispute that isn't vandalism. Administrator powers should be used to help keep the wiki clear of vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple disagreements between users acting in [[w:Assume good faith|good faith]].  Ideally an admin shouldn't be considered "in charge". The ideal admin is just someone who is trusted to have a few extra buttons and to use them for the benefit of the Wikia community.

&lt;!--COMMENT  Please do not make any changes above this line.
                         Feel free to make any changes below.
                         This is the sandbox where you can play and try out wiki editing safely. --&gt;

This page is for any tests.

Welcome to the sandbox!

Anyone can edit this.

==Simple Editing==

To edit a page, click on the "edit" tab, usually near the top of the page.  Then, edit the box in the page.  Feel free to practice here, on this page.  It's here just for you to practice.

A blank line indicates a paragraph separation.

You can link to another page by putting the name or title of that page in double square brackets.
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Main Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; becomes [[Main Page]].

==Simple Formatting==

Create headers by putting text inbetween repeated equal (=) signs.  The more =, the lower level the heading is.

Create a bulleted list by starting each item with an asterisk (*)
* it's ok to make editing mistakes
* you can preview your work before saving it
* even after saving it, you or someone else can edit it again to make it even better

==Formatting for Emphasis==

Put single quote marks around words or phrases for formatting emphasis.

Two single quotes, like &lt;nowiki&gt;''italics''&lt;/nowiki&gt; will create ''italics''.

Three single quotes, like &lt;nowiki&gt;'''bold text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; will create '''bold text'''.

----
Other stuff...

If you know HTML or CSS formatting commands, they can also be used in this wiki.  One useful HTML command is &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; which creates a line break.

If you want to show what a command looks like, rather than actually implementing the command, surround it with the '''nowiki''' command.</text>

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3285">[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]], the free encyclopedia, is the largest and most successful wiki. This page lists some of the overarching guidelines that have helped make ''Wikipedia'' a success. You may like to consider them for this Wikia.

# '''BE BOLD!''' in updating pages. Go ahead, it's a wiki! &lt;br /&gt;Encourage others, including those who disagree with you, likewise to  '''BE BOLD!'''
# '''Be civil''' to other users at all times.
# '''Ignore all rules'''. If the rules discourage you from improving or maintaining the wiki's quality, ignore them.
# '''When in doubt, take it to the [[Help:Talk page|talk page]]'''. We have all the time in the world. Mutual respect is the guiding behavioral principle of Wikia and, although everyone knows that their writing may be edited mercilessly, it is easier to accept changes if the reasons for them are understood. If you discuss changes on the article's ''talk'' (or ''discussion'') page  before you make them, you should reach consensus faster and happier.
#'''[[Project:Copyrights|Respect copyright]]'''. Wikia uses the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License GNU Free Documentation License]. Everything you contribute must be compatible with that license.
# '''Decent edit summaries''' and clear and transparent explanations are universally appreciated. Other editors need to understand your process, and it also helps you yourself to understand what you did after a long leave of absence from an article. Please state '''''what''''' you changed and '''''why'''''. If the explanation is too long, add more on the discussion page.
#'''Assume good faith'''; in other words, try to consider that the person on the other end of the discussion is a thinking, rational being who is trying to positively contribute to the project — unless, and only unless, you have firm, solid, and objective proof to the contrary. Merely disagreeing with you is no such proof.
#Particularly, '''don't revert good faith edits'''. [[Help:Reverting|Reverting]] is  ''too'' powerful sometimes. Don't succumb to the temptation, unless you're reverting very obvious vandalism &lt;small&gt;(like "LALALALAL*&amp;*@#@THIS_SUX0RZ", or someone changing "1+2=3" to "1+2='''17'''")&lt;/small&gt;. If you really can't stand something, revert once, with an edit summary something like "(rv) I disagree strongly, I'll explain why in talk."  and immediately take it to talk.
# '''No personal attacks'''. Don't write that user such and so is an idiot, or insult him/her (even if (s)he ''is'' an idiot). Instead, explain what they did wrong, why it is wrong, and how to fix it. If possible, fix it yourself (but see above).
# '''Be graceful''': ''Be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you do''. Try to accommodate other people's quirks the best you can, but try to be as polite, solid, and straightforward as possible yourself.
# '''Sign your posts on talk pages''' using &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which gets replaced by your username and timestamp when you hit Save.  But don't sign on mainspace articles.
# '''Use the preview button'''; it helps prevents edit conflicts and mistakes.

It's important to have fun... but try to make sure those around you have fun too!

Welcome to the '''{{SITENAME}}'s sandbox'''!&lt;br /&gt;
This page exists so that you can practice editing or formatting (see [[Help:Editing|Editing help]]) without changing any serious content.  Feel free to try wiki editing out here first.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a [[wikia:Help:Tutorial_1|tutorial]] on the Central (coordinating) Wikia that will step you through more of the things you can do.  Wiki allow for rather complicated formatting.  It can look overwhelming when you begin, but don't let it worry you.  Just start with the basics... enter some text, and learn the other pieces as you go.  Your content contributions are welcome and important.  The wiki is a collaborative effort and others can help with formatting and other improvements.&lt;br /&gt;
Best wishes!

==Dating==
Without a [[Nonman]] standardized dating system (they find humanity's desire for such accuracy to be baffling), there is no way to reconstruct the exact chronology of the First Age. However, according to [[R. Scott Bakker]], the maximum lifespan of the [[Nonmen]] before the [[Womb Plague]] was approximately 400 years. [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] was in his prime when the [[Incû-Holoinas]] fell from the skies and was near death when the Womb Plague took place, suggesting these events spanned 200-300 years. The Womb Plague marked the beginning of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], which are said to have lasted five centuries. The [[Breaking of the Gates]] and the invasion of men then began an unknown period after that. This suggests the events of the First Age, as recounted, may have lasted for around one thousand years and potentially significantly longer.

Two important clues are given to the dating of events: the claim that the [[Heron Spear]] spent "thousands of years" in [[Ishoriöl]] (so at least 2,000 years passed between the Heron Spear being installed there and its theft circa 750 Year-of-the-Tusk)&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Heron Spear'&lt;/ref&gt;; and the suggestion by [[Cet’ingira]] in 4132 that he had lived for 8,000 years (placing the Inoculation in a 400-year span around that point, depending on his age upon receiving it, and Arkfall a century to three centuries before that). The latter claim may be debatable, due to the Erratic's own issues with memory and madness.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Breaking of the Gates marks the beginning of the calendar of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]], which all subsequent events are dated from.

==The First Age==
The First Age began with the founding of Nonman civilisation by [[Imimorûl]] and concluded with the Breaking of the Gates, from which time human civilisation in [[Eärwa]] is dated. This period of time is chronicled in the Nonman historical and spiritual text, the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'', but human chroniclers find it difficult to read the volume due to its chronicling of events in reverse order (so, from newest to oldest) since the Nonmen believe that to understand events you have to first know the consequence. There is also no methodology of dating events in the work, either reliably to one another or to later events.

The central and most important sequence of events in the First Age are the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], which began (arguably) with the [[Arkfall]], were suspended during the [[Inoculation]], began again with the [[Womb Plague]] and concluded with the [[Battle of Isal’imial]] and the cleansing of the Ark five centuries later.

==Approximate sequence of events in the First Age==
* '''[[Nonmen]] Prehistory''': [[Imimorûl]] is banished from the heavens and founds Nonman civilisation. Siöl and Nihrimsul are founded. Imimorûl dies, [[Tsonos]] succeeds him. Siöl founds [[Ishoriöl]], Viri, [[Cil-Aujas]] and [[Illisserû]]; they in turn found [[Curunq]], [[Cil-Aumûl]] and [[Incissal]].
* '''[[Thousand Year Siege]]''': Siöl and Nihrimsul fight many skirmishes, most notably the [[Thousand Year Siege]], before an uneasy peace develops.
* '''[[Arkfall]]''': The [[Incû-Holoinas]] crashes in western Viri, devastating the Mansion's domains. Siöl invades and conquers Viri, Nihrimsul and Cil-Aujas in short order. First contact is made with the [[Inchoroi]]. The [[First Watch]] is placed about the Ark.
* '''[[Battle of Pir Pahal]]''': The Inchoroi ally with Nin’janjin, the Traitor-King of Viri. They breach the First Watch in the First Battle of the Ark. [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] rallies the Four Mansions and defeats the Inchoroi on the field of Pir Pahal, slaying [[Sil]], King of the Inchoroi and seizing the [[Heron Spear]]. The Inchoroi and Nin'janjin retreat to the Ark. Nihrimsul and Cil-Aujas rebel against Cû’jara-Cinmoi. The [[Second Watch]] begins.
* '''Siöl-Nihrimsul Wars''': The two Mansions fight a long (100-200 year) campaign, with Siöl eventually recapturing Cil-Aujas. Nihrimsul refuses to surrender again, however. [[Sin’niroiha]] is gifted the [[False Sun|Day Lantern]] by [[Emilidis]] and uses this to establish an alliance with Ishoriöl. Wary of Ishoriöl's strength, Cû’jara-Cinmoi sues for peace.
* '''The [[Inoculation]]''': Nin'janjin, acting as an emissary for the Inchoroi, sues for peace with the ageing and failing Cû’jara-Cinmoi. Cû’jara-Cinmoi agrees on the condition that the Inchoroi share the secret of immortality with the Nonmen. The Second Watch is disbanded and the Inchoroi begin administering to the Nonmen.
* '''The [[Womb Plague]]''': Over 100 years after the Inoculation begins, all Nonmen women die as a result of the Inchoroi plotting. Cû’jara-Cinmoi declares vengeance and summons the might of all the High Mansions to war.
* '''[[Battle of Pir Minginnial]]''': Second Battle of the Ark. Cû’jara-Cinmoi is slain on the field of [[Inniür-Shigogli]] by the treachery of Nin'janjin. [[Chorae]], [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag|Bashrags]] and [[Wracu]] appear for the first time. Sin’niroiha rallies the Nonmen and withdraws from the field.
* '''[[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]''': Lasting 500 years after Pir Minginnial (some hold that the wars began with Arkfall, others with the Womb Plague and Pir Minginnial).
** '''Sieges of Ishoriöl''': The Exalted Mansion spends over 50 years under siege in five separate campaigns. Sin’niroiha becomes the last Nonman to die of old age and is succeeded by his son, [[Nil’giccas]].
** '''[[Battle of Imogirion]]''': The Mansion of [[Illisserû]] mounts a seaborne assault on the Inchoroi, landing an invasion force on the [[Leash]] and marching on the Ark. They are defeated with great loss of life. Only one of the invaders lives to see home again.
** '''Second Summoning''': Nil'giccas unites the High Mansions a second time and assembles a host mighty enough to challenge the Inchoroi.
** '''[[Battle of Isal’imial]]''': Nil'giccas and his host smash the Inchoroi armies in the shadow of the Ark, driving the Sranc into the [[Yimaleti Mountains]], allegedly completely destroying the Inchoroi and breaching the Ark.
** '''Cleansing of the Ark''': The Nonmen spend twenty years looting and desecrating the Ark, but are unable to destroy it. Troubled by the [[Golden Room]] and the [[Inverse Fire]] it holds, and outright disturbed by the testimony of the captive Nin'janjin and [[Cet’ingira]], Nil'giccas has the [[Barricades]] raised around the Ark and then evacuate it, forbidding any from coming close.
* Centuries after the Cleansing, the two surviving Inchoroi create the Tusk and gift it to the men of [[Eänna]]. The Tusk is an accurate collection of their scriptures with only one insertion: the religious command to invade Eärwa and kill the Nonmen.

==The Second Age==
===Far Antiquity ''(0-2155)''===
* '''0'''—The legendary [[Gates of Eärwa|Breaking of the Gates]],{{EG|Year-of-the-Tusk}} the name given to the assault on the Gates of Eärwa, a series of fortified passes through the [[Great Kayarsus]], by the Men of [[Eänna]].{{EG|Breaking of the Gates}} [[Angeshraël]], the most famed Old Prophet of the Tusk, leads the [[Five Tribes of Men]]: the [[Norsirai]], the [[Ketyai]], the [[Satyothi]], the [[Scylvendi]], and the [[Xiuhianni]] into Eärwa,{{EG|Angeshraël}} though according to ''The Chronicle of the Tusk,'' the Xiuhianni refused to follow the other four tribes.{{EG|Xiuhianni}} This marks the beginning of the Second Age.{{EG|Five Tribes of Men}} It is also the beginning of [[Far Antiquity]],{{EG|Far Antiquity}} or the Age of Bronze when bronze was the dominant technology of Men.{{EG|Age of Bronze}} Since ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'' ends with the determination to invade Eärwa, or the Land of the “Uplifted Sun,” and since the Nonman Mansions most involved in resisting the Tribes of Men were all destroyed, very little is known either of the Breaking of the Gates or of the subsequent migratory invasions.{{EG|Breaking of the Gates}}
* '''?'''—The Prophet Angeshraël incites the Four Nations of Men to embark on a holy war of extermination the Nonmen.{{EG|Nonmen}} Nonmen and Men fight the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]], of which very few accounts exist.{{EG|Cûno-Halaroi Wars}} Within the course of a few generations Nonmen were nearly exterminated. Only the Mansions of Ishoriöl and Cil-Aujas survived.{{EG|Nonmen}}
* '''?'''—The [[Jiünati Steppe]] is inhabited by Scylvendi pastoralists.{{EG|Jiünati Steppe}}

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10947">The '''Tusk''' is the premier holy artifact of both the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] and [[Kiünnat]] traditions, and the most unholy in the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] tradition, where it is referred to as Rouk Spara (“Cursed Thorn” in Kianni).{{EG|Tusk, the}} The text itself is the scriptural foundation for all mannish faiths save Fanimry.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}} For the Inrithi ''[[The Tractate]]'' is both the prophesied culmination and an amendment of ''The Chronicle of the Tusk''.{{EG|''Tractate, The''}}[[File:Tusk.jpg|thumb|300px|The Tusk, the original scripture of the Five Tribes of Eärwa.]]

==The Object==
''The Chronicle of the Tusk'' is the most ancient extant human text in [[Eärwa]].{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}} It is written in Thoti-Eännorean, the alleged mother tongue of all [[Men]].{{EG|Thoti-Eännorean}} As the oldest literate work, its provenance is almost entirely unknown. Many Inrithi commentators have pointed out that it must have been a collective work, cobbled together from many (likely oral) sources over a period of many years.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}} Since the Tusk bears the oldest extant version of ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'', its provenance remains an utter mystery to men, though most scholars agree that it predates the coming of the [[Five Tribes of Men]] to Eärwa.{{EG|Tusk, the}} Like most scriptures, its popular interpretation is highly selective and idealized.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}}

The Tusk has always been in the possession of one tribe, the [[Ketyai]]. Throughout most of recorded history, since the earliest days of [[Shigek]], before even the rise of [[Kyraneas]], the Tusk has been installed in [[Sumna]], holiest city of Inrithism located in [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]].{{1|3}}{{EG|Tusk, the}} Though during the [[Apocalypse]], after the [[Battle of Mehsarunath]] in 2154, the Tusk was evacuated and brought to ancient [[Invishi]] in [[Nilnamesh]].{{EG|Apocalypse}}{{EG|Sumna}} The Tusk is enshrined in the [[Junriüma]], also known as the Vault-of-the-Tusk, an ancient fortress-temple located in the heart of the [[Hagerna]] in Sumna.{{EG|Junriüma}}

It has recently been revealed that the Tusk was gifted to the Ketyai by the [[Inchoroi]]. ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'' consists for the most part of the stories and traditions of men before they crossed the mountains, with one ‘devious addition’: the command to invade Eärwa and destroy the [[Nonmen|‘False Men’]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2011/07/r-scott-bakker-interview-part-2.html Interview with R. Scott Bakker at Pat’s Fantasy Hotlist]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Text==
''The Chronicle of the Tusk'' consists of six books: the Book of Canticles, the Book of Gods, the Book of Hintarates, the Book of Songs, the Book of Tribes, and the Book of Warrants.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}}

===Book of Canticles===
Canticles contains the old “Tusk Laws” regarding every aspect of personal and public life. In Inrithi tradition these were superseded by the revised strictures of ''The Tractate'',{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}} though it is still referred to in cases on which [[Inri Sejenus]] was silent.{{EG|Law of the Tusk}}

Known laws include:
*Concerning [[Sorcerer]]s, “Cut from them their tongues, for their blasphemy is an abomination like no other …”{{1|2}}{{EG|“Cut from them their tounges …”}} “Burn them, for they are Unclean.”{{2|9}} From this text, Inrithi call sorcerers the Unclean.{{EG|Unclean, the}}
*Children are to be stoned to death for striking their parents.{{2|16}}
*When a man murdered some other man’s brother, his ''own'' brother is to be executed.{{2|16}}
*Verse 19:9{{EG|“suffer not a whore to live …”}} “Suffer not a whore to live, for she maketh a pit of her womb!{{1|10}}{{2|16}} Suffer not a whore to ''breathe'', for she mocks the seed of the righteous! Stone her so that thy hand shall not be tempt—”{{1|10}}
*False Prophets are banned.{{2|11}} The punishment is to be scourged.{{2|22}}
*Verse 18:9 “As death is the sum of all harms, so is murder the sum of all sins.”{{5|5}}

===Book of Gods===
The primary scripture of the [[Cults]], enumerating the various [[Gods]], and explaining the rites of purification and propitiation basic to each.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}} Collectively these Gods are known as the Hundred Gods.{{EG|Hundred Gods}} [[Ajokli]] is listed among the primary Gods,{{EG|Ajokli}} and [[Yatwer]] is anything but revered in ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'' (wherein “tillers of soil” are often referred to with contempt).{{EG|Yatwer}}

===Book of Hintarates===
The story of Hintarates describes an upright man plagued with apparently undeserved adversity.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}}

===Book of Songs===
A collection of verse prayers and parables extolling the virtues of piety, manliness, courage, and tribal loyalty.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}}

Lines include:
*Verse 57:3 “For all things there is a toll. We pay in breaths, and our purse is soon empty.”{{2|22}}
*“There is no friend more difficult, than a sinner.”{{2|12}}
*Verse 6:33 “You are fallen from Him like sparks from the flame. A dark wind blows, and you are soon to flicker out.”{{3|10}}

===Book of Tribes===
Tribes presents the extended narrative of the first Prophets and Chieftain-Kings of the Five Tribes of Men before the invasion of Eärwa.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}}

[[Angeshraël]] is the most famed Old Prophet of the Tusk, responsible for leading the Five Tribes of Men into Eärwa.{{EG|Angeshraël}} While on [[Mount Eshki]], the “Mountain of Revelation,” the Prophet Angeshraël received the call to lead the Tribes of Men into Eärwa.{{EG|Mount Eshki}} After coming down from the mountain he is confronted by [[Husyelt]], and bows his face into his fire.{{EG|Angeshraël}}

Kellhus describes this as follows:
:The Prophet Angeshrael, came down from his fast on Mount Eshki. [[Husyelt]], the Tusk tells us, sent a hare to him, so he might eat at last. Angeshrael skinned the Hunter’s gift and struck a fire so he might feast. When he had eaten and was content, sacred Husyelt, the Holy Stalker, joined him at his fire, for the Gods in those days had not left the world in the charge of Men. Angeshrael, recognising the God as the God, fell immediately to his knees before the fire, not thinking where he would throw his face. Like a young man on his wedding night, he erred in his eagerness . . . And the God said, ‘Why does our Prophet fall to his knees only? Are not Prophets Men like other Men? Should they not throw their faces to the earth?’ To which Angeshrael replied, ‘I find my fire before me.’ And peerless Husyelt said, ‘The fire burns across earth, and what fire consumes becomes earth. I am your God. Throw your face to the earth.’ So Angeshrael, the Tusk tells us, ''bowed his head into the flames.'' Angeshrael. The Burnt Prophet. ''He lowered his face into fire! Fire!''{{2|11}}

Angeshraël seeks to convince the Tribes of men, called the Children of [[Eänna]] in the Tusk,{{EG|Children of Eänna}} to cross the [[Great Kayarsus]] mountains, and on [[Mount Kinsureah]], the “Mountain of Summoning,” he sacrifices [[Oresh]], the youngest of his sons by his wife Esmenet,{{EG|Angeshraël}} to demonstrate his conviction to the Tribes of Men.{{EG|Mount Kinsureah}} Four tribes agree, but the [[Xiuhianni]], a black-haired, brown-eyed, olive-skinned race, refuse to follow the other four tribes into Eärwa.{{EG|Xiuhianni}}

Angeshraël also incites the Four Nations of Men to embark on a holy war of extermination against the Nonmen of Eärwa. The Tusk generally refers to Nonmen as Oserukki, the “Not Us.” Angeshraël alternately refers to them as “the Accursed Ones” and “the sodomite Kings of Eärwa,” According to the Tusk, the Nonmen are anathema:
:''Hearken, for this the God has said, ''
:''“These False Men offend Me;''
:''blot out all mark of their Passing”''{{EG|Nonmen}}

Verse 21:13 states:
:“And We will give over all of them, slain, to the Children of Eänna; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire. You shall bathe your feet in the blood of the wicked.”{{2|21}}

The Chieftain-Kings; [[Shelgal]], [[Mamayma]], [[Nomur]], [[Inshull]] and [[Uskelt Wolfheart]], lead the tribes into Eärwa.{{2|24}}{{EG|Shelgal}}{{EG|Mamayma}}{{EG|Nomur}}{{EG|Inshull}}{{EG|Uskelt Wolfheart}} ''The Tusk'' ends with the determination to invade Eärwa, or the Land of the “Uplifted Sun.”{{EG|Breaking of the Gates}}

Verse 6:42 states:
:''"Look unto other and ponder the sin and folly you find there. For their sin is your sin, and their folly is your folly. Seek ye the true reflecting pool? Look to the stranger you despites, not the friend you love."''

===Book of Warrants===
Warrants is an account of the observances governing the interactions between [[caste]]s.{{EG|''Chronicle of the Tusk, The''}}

Verse 7:48 reads:
:“Bring he who has spoken prophecy to the judgement of the priests, and if his prophecy is judged true, acclaim him, for he is clean, and if his prophecy is judged false, bind him to the corpse of his wife, and hang him one cubit above the earth, for he is unclean, an anathema unto the Gods.”{{2|23}}

The punishment is described as follows:
:Before roaring mobs, Incheiri Gotian had stripped Kellhus of his clothing, then whipped him with cedar branches until he’d bled from a hundred places. Afterward, they bound his bleeding body to Serwë’s nude corpse, ankle to ankle, wrist to wrist, face to face. Then they lashed the two of them, limbs outstretched, to a great bronze ring, which they hoisted and chained—upside down no less—to the winding girth of Umiaki’s lowest and mightiest limb.{{2|23}}

===Texts of unknown origin===
The following texts are stated to be from ''The Chronicle of the Tusk,'' but it is unclear what book they come from.

*“All things both sacred and vile, speak to the hearts of Men, and they are bewildered, and holding out their hands to darkness, ''they name it light.”''{{2|22}}
*“Hearken Truth, for it strides fiercely among you, and will not be denied.”{{2|22}}
*“Fear him, for he is the deceiver, the Lie made Flesh, come among you to foul the waters of your heart.”{{2|22}}

A [[Shaman]] is both prophet and sorcerer.{{2|12}}

The original Men of Eärwa, slaves of the Nonmen, were called the [[Emwama]].{{EG|Languages of Men}}
The Text also describes a ritual preformed after battle:
:That evening Gotian directed his fellow Great Names to set their booted feet upon the man’s cheek, saying, “Cherish the power the God has given us over our enemies.” It was an ancient ritual, first practised in the days of the Tusk. Afterward, they hung the Sapatishah from a tree.{{2|21}}

The Encyclopedic Glossary describes twelve gods who were worshipped by the [[Kiünnat]] and latter by the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]]. While the Kiünnat understand these as separate Gods, the Inrithi see “the unity of the individual deities of the Cults as Aspects of the God”.{{EG|Inrithism}} The [[Fanimry|Fanim]] believe in only one God, viewing the other Gods worshipped by the Inrithi as demons.{{EG|Fanimry}}

==[[God of Gods|The God of Gods]]==
In Inrithi tradition, the unitary, omniscient, omnipotent, and immanent being responsible for existence, of which the Hundred Gods (and in some strains [[Men]]) are but “aspects”. In the Kiünnat tradition, the God is more an abstract placeholder than anything else. In the Fanim tradition, the God is the unitary, omniscient, omnipotent, and ''transcendent'' being responsible for existence (thus the “[[Solitary God]]”), against which the Hundred Gods war for the hearts of men.{{EG|God, the}}

==The Hundred Gods==
The collective name of the Gods enumerated in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'' and worshipped either under the auspices of the [[Cults]] (which is to say, subordinate to the [[Thousand Temples]]), or in the traditional versions of the Kiünnat. In the Inrithi tradition, the Hundred Gods are thought to be aspects of the God (whom [[Inri Sejenus]] famously called “the Million Souled”), much the same way various personality traits could be said to inhabit a single individual. In the far more variegated Kiünnat tradition, the Hundred Gods are thought to be independent spiritual agencies, prone to indirectly intervene in the lives of their worshippers. Both traditions recognize the differences between the '''Compensatory Gods''', who promise direct reward for worship and devotion, the '''Punitive Gods''', who secure sacrifices through the threat of suffering, and the more rare '''Bellicose Gods''', who despise worship as sycophancy and favour those who strive against them. Both the Inrithi and Kiünnat traditions see the Gods as indispensable to eternal life in the Outside.

The esoteric apologist [[Zarathinius]] is infamous for arguing (in ''[[A Defence of the Arcane Arts]]'') the absurdity of worshipping deities as imperfect and capricious as mere Men. The Fanim, of course, believe the Hundred Gods are renegade slaves of the Solitary God — demons.{{EG|Hundred Gods}}

===[[Ajokli]], God of thievery and deception===
[[File:Ajokli.jpg|thumb|300px|The god of deception and trickery, Ajokli is also known as the Four-Horned Brother.]]
Though listed among the primary Gods in ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'', there is no true Cult of Ajokli, but rather an informal network of devotees scattered across the great cities of the [[Three Seas]]. Ajokli is oft mentioned in the secondary scriptures of the different Cults, sometimes as a mischievous companion of the Gods, other times as a cruel or malicious competitor. In the ''[[Mar’eddat]]'', he is the faithless husband of Gierra.{{EG|Ajokli}} Idols of Ajokli show him as a leering figure with a huge penis that reaches up to his chin.{{3|10}}

===[[Akkeägni]], God of disease===
[[File:Akkeagni.jpg|thumb|300px|The god of disease, Akkeägni is the patron of most physicians in the Three Seas, rewarding those who strive against his influence.]]
Also known as the God of a Thousand Hands. Scholars have oft noted the irony that the Priesthood of Disease provides the primary repository of physicians for the Three Seas. How can one at once worship disease and war against it? According to the scriptures of the Cult, the ''[[Piranavas]]'', Akkeägni is a so-called Bellicose God, one who favours those who strive against him over sycophants and worshippers.{{EG|Akkeägni}} Some of Akkeägni’s priests bear tattoos. They also use small prayer chimes which sound thanks to Akkeägni,{{1|19}} and use pharmaka and reliquaries to combat illness.{{2|18}}

===[[Anagkë]], Goddess of fortune===
[[File:Anagke.jpg|thumb|300px|The goddess of fortune, Anagkë is also called the Whore of Fate, and is the younger sister of Bukris, god of famine.]]
Also known as “the Whore of Fate”. Anagkë is one of the primary Compensatory Gods, which is to say, one who rewards devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife. Her Cult is extremely popular in the Three Seas, especially among the higher, political [[caste]]s.{{EG|Anagkë}} According to old Kiünnat tradition, Anagkë is the younger sister of Bukris.{{EG|Bukris}} Anagkë is also commonly called simply the Whore,{{EG|Whore, the}} or the Whore of Fate.{{1|5}} Anagkë also seems to be associated with the stars. In the text is said that a star “had just entered the horizon of Anagkë, the Whore of Fate”. The augur calls this “an excellent conjunction”.{{1|5}}

===[[Bukris]], God of famine===
[[File:Bukris.jpg|thumb|300px|The god of famine, Bukris is the older brother of Anagkë, the Whore of Fate.]]
As one of the so-called Punitive Gods, who command sacrifices through threat and the imposition of suffering, Bukris has no real Cult or priesthood. According to Kiünnat tradition, Bukris is the older brother of Anagkë, which is why Anagkean Cultic Priests typically administer the rites of propitiation during times of hunger.{{EG|Bukris}}

===[[Gierra]], Goddess of carnal passion===
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Gierra is very popular throughout the Three Seas, particularly among aging men drawn to the “aphrodisica”, Cultic nostrums reputed to enhance virility. In the ''[[Higarata]]'', the collection of subsidiary writings that form the scriptural core of the Cults, Gierra is rarely depicted with any consistency, and is often cast as a malign temptress, luring men to the luxury of her couch, often with fatal consequences.{{EG|Gierra}} In the ''Mar’eddat'', she is wife of the faithless Ajokli.{{EG|Ajokli}} Gierra’s “voluptuous” idol, depicts “wide-thrown ankles”.{{3|10}}

“The temple prostitutes of Gierra believes, that despite the hundreds of men who uses them, they couples with only ''one'', Hotos, the Priapic God.”{{3|6}} Priestesses of Gierra tattoo their limbs in inscriptions and cover their bodies with oil.{{1|3}} Part of their duties is to have sex with male worshippers.{{1|11}} [[Sumna|Sumni]] harlots must have the [[Sign of Gierra]], twin serpents, tattooed on the back of their left hand, apparently in imitation of the Priestesses of Gierra.{{EG|Sign of Gierra}}

===[[Gilgaöl]], God of war and conflict===
[[File:Gilgaol.jpg|thumb|300px|The god of conflict and war, Gilgaöl is the brother of Yatwer.]]
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Gilgaöl is the second most popular of the Hundred Gods, only after his sister Yatwer. In the ''Higarata'', the collection of subsidiary writings that form the scriptural core of the Cults, Gilgaöl is depicted as harsh and sceptical of Men, continually demanding proof of worth from those who would follow him. Though subordinate to the Thousand Temples, the Gilgallic Cult boasts nearly as many priests, and perhaps receives more in the way of sacrificial donations.{{EG|Gilgaöl}} Gilgaöl is also known as the Shield-Breaker{{EG|Shield-Breaker, the}} and One-Eyed War.{{2|5}}
At least the position of High Cultist of Gilgaöl is hereditary. The priests took part in the celebration of [[Ikurei Conphas]]’s victory over the [[Scylvendi]]:
:“In accordance with custom, the hereditary priests of Gilgaöl brought basins of water. As Conphas expected, they smeared lion’s blood on his limbs and, muttering prayers, cleansed his symbolic wounds.”{{1|7}}
They also sacrifice goshawks, dogs and lions, by burning them in godfires for the sake of those at war.{{1|7}}{{2|6}}{{2|18}} Other goshawks are released into the setting evening sun.{{2|18}} At least in one case, the hide of a lion was retained by the offerer.{{1|7}} After battle the priests of Gilgaöl preside over the declaration of Battle-Celebrant. In their ornamental red hauberks, the Gilgallic Priests rise to declare the Battle-Celebrant. The High Cultist of Gilgaöl, steps to the forefront of the others, performs the Gilgallic rites, and moves to stand over the Battle-Celebrant. He is told to kneel, and a circlet woven of thorns and olive sprigs, is placed on his head; the High Cultist of Gilgaöl finally cries, “Rise, [name], … Battle-Celebrant!”{{2|7}} It is also the task of the High Cultist to consult his omen-texts to determine the will of the God.{{2|20}}

===[[Husyelt]], God of the hunt===
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Husyelt comes after only Yatwer and Gilgaöl in Cultic popularity, particularly in the Middle-North. In the ''Higarata'', the collection of subsidiary writings that form the scriptural core of the Cults, Husyelt is depicted as the most anthropocentric of the Hundred Gods, as intent upon enabling his worshippers as he is upon securing their obedience and devotion.{{EG|Husyelt}} In ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'', after:
:“The Prophet Angeshraël came down from his fast on Mount Eshki. Husyelt, the Tusk tells us, sent a hare to him, so he might eat at last. Angeshraël skinned the Hunter’s gift and struck a fire so he might feast. When he had eaten and was content, sacred Husyelt, the Holy Stalker, joined him at his fire, for the Gods in those days had not left the world in the charge of Men. Angeshraël, recognizing the God as the God, fell immediately to his knees before the fire, not thinking where he would throw his face. And the God said, ‘Why does our Prophet fall to his knees only? Are not Prophets Men like other Men? Should they not throw their faces to the earth?’ To which Angeshraël replied, ‘I find my fire before me.’ And peerless Husyelt said, ‘The fire burns across earth, and what fire consumes becomes earth. I am your God. Throw your face to the earth.’ So Angeshraël, the Tusk tells us, bowed his head ''into the flames''.”{{2|11}}
The Cult of Husyelt is rumoured to be extraordinarily wealthy, and high-ranking members of the Husyeltic priesthood often possess as much political clout as Shrial apparati.{{EG|Husyelt}} Shanks of butchered antelope are burned for Husyelt.{{2|6}} After cursing, some superstitious people counter by making “the sign of Husyelt, the Dark Hunter”.{{1|p}} Husyelt is also commonly called the Dark Hunter and the Stalker.{{EG|Dark Hunter, the}}{{EG|Stalker, the}}

===Jukan, God of sky and season===
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Jukan almost rivals Yatwer in popularity among peasants yet is scarcely represented in major urban centres. The priests of Jukan are readily recognizable by their blue-painted skin. The Marjukari, an extreme ascetic branch of the Jukanic Cult, are notorious for living as hermits on mountaintops.{{EG|Jukan}} During the mass migration to Momemn before the Holy War, priests of Jukan led people while singing soft hymns and clinking finger cymbals.{{1|10}}

===Juru, God of virility and fertility===
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Juru is popular among aging caste-noble men, and possesses only a handful of temples, most of them found in major cities. It is often mocked as the Mistress Cult.{{EG|Juru}}

===Momas, God of storms, seas, and chance===
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Momas is the primary deity worshipped by seamen and merchants, and is the patron divinity of Momemn (whose name means "Praise Momas") and of Cironj. In the ''Higarata'', he is depicted as cruel, even malicious, and obsessed with minute matters of propriety—leading some commentators to suggest he is in fact a Bellicose, as opposed to a Compensatory, God. His primary device is the White Triangle on Black (representing the Shark’s Tooth worn by all devotees of Momas).{{EG|Momas}} During storms, sailors will wail and supplicate themselves to Momas.{{1|3}} Additionally, Nroni fishermen attribute a good catch to Momas.{{1|4}} During the Feast of Kussapokari, which marks the summer solstice, the upper castes in Momemn celebrate on pleasure galleys, where the first swallow is spat into the sea as a propitiation to Momas.{{1|19}}

===[[Onkis]], Goddess of hope and aspiration===
[[File:Onkis.jpg|thumb|300px|Goddess of hope and aspiration, Onkis is also known as the Singer-in-the-Dark, she who drives men to forever reach for more than they can hold.]]
One of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Onkis draws followers from all walks of life, though rarely in great numbers. She is only mentioned twice in the ''Higarata'', and in the (likely apocryphal) ''[[Parnishtas]]'' she is portrayed as a prophetess, not of the future, but of the motivations of Men. The so-called “shakers” belong to an extreme branch of the Cult, where the devotees ritually strive to be “possessed” by the Goddess. Her symbol is the Copper Tree (which also happens to be the device of the ancient Nonman Mansion of [[Siöl]], though no link has been established).{{EG|Onkis}} Onkis is also called the Singer-in-the-Dark.{{1|4}} Her idol depicts the severed head of a beautiful woman upon a copper tree.{{3|10}} In the [[Irreüma]] in Sumna, her idol is described as:
:“The idol worked in white marble, eyes closed with the sunken look of the dead. At first glance she appeared to be the severed head of a woman, beautiful yet vaguely common, mounted on a pole. Anything more than a glance, however, revealed the pole to be a miniature tree, like those cultivated by the ancient [[Norsirai]], only worked in bronze. Branches poked through her parted lips and swept across her face — nature reborn through human lips. Other branches reached behind to break through her frozen hair.”{{1|4}}
The idol also has a small trough gouged in her pedestal for food offerings.{{1|4}}

===[[Yatwer]], Goddess of fertility===
[[File:Yatwer.jpg|thumb|300px|The Monstrous Mother of Birth, Yatwer envisioned as a cosmic Ciphrang-type being, oldest and most powerful of the Hundred Gods of Eärwa. Readers don’t know what form she actually takes, but this was a fun pic to do.]]
She is one of the so-called Compensatory Gods, who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife.{{EG|Yatwer}} While Gilgaöl is the most popular deity among caste-nobles, his sister Yatwer is favoured by the lower castes — some six out of ten caste-menials regularly attend some kind of Yatwerian rite. So Yatwer is far and away the most popular of the Hundred.{{4|5}} In the ''Higarata'', the collection of subsidiary writings that form the scriptural core of the Cults, Yatwer is depicted as a beneficent, all-forgiving matron, capable of seeding and furrowing the fields of nations with a single hand. Some commentators have noted that Yatwer is anything but revered in either the ''Higarata'' or ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'' (wherein “tillers of soil” are often referred to with contempt). This is why Yatwerians tend to rely on their own scripture, the ''[[Sinyatwa]]'', for their liturgical rites and ceremonies. Despite the vast numbers of adherents enjoyed by the Cult, it remains one of the more impoverished, and seems to generate a large number of zealous devotees as a result.{{EG|Yatwer}} Her symbol is a harvest sickle that also forms the outline of a pregnant belly.{{4|5}}
:“The Cultic priestesses of Yatwer, always drag ''two'' victims — usually spring lambs — to the sacrificial altar, one to pass under the knife, the other to witness the sacred passage. In this way, every beast thrown upon the altar always knows, in its dim way, what is about to happen. For the Yatwerians, ritual isn’t enough: the transformation of casual slaughter into true sacrifice requires ''recognition''.”{{2|3}}
One knowing lamb is equal to ten unwitting bulls, it is held.{{EG|“one lamb for ten bulls”}} Yatwerian priestesses also use unguents of manure.{{2|7}} Yatwer is a Point of View character in ''[[The White-Luck Warrior (Book)|The White-Luck Warrior]]''.{{5|10}}

[[Sorcery|Magic]] in the world of [[Eärwa]] is the use of the sorcerer's will to forcibly influence reality. Since it is unnatural, destructive and poses a great danger, sorcery is viewed as a terrible blasphemy by the [[Thousand Temples]] and is widely condemned by faithful [[Inrithi]]. Sorcerous Schools arose in response to this pressure, creating powerful political forces apart from the oppressive religious order.

The human population of Eärwa is mostly unable to use magic. Rather, magic is an unnatural taint that surfaces only in a small amount of people known as the Few. The Schools of magic only allow male practitioners, further dwindling the number of possible sorcerers. Even though those who choose to study sorcery are granted much power, it is mostly balanced out by the forces of religious intolerance and by [[Chorae]], spherical anti-magic objects that will destroy any sorcerer on contact.

There are two main types of magic used in the [[Three Seas]]: the [[Gnostic]] and the [[Anagogic]]. While the Gnostic art (invented by the [[Nonmen]] but mostly destroyed during the First [[Apocalypse]]) is superior, the inferior Anagogic is the most common.

It is interessting to notice that the word '''Gnostic''' refers to ''knowledge'' in Ancient Greek, while the word '''Anagogic''' refers to ''mystical interpretation, and'' '''Psukhe''' comes from ''soul'' in the same language. So knowledge is superior to mystical interpretation, which is superior to soul in Eärwa.

==Schools in the Three Seas==
===Gnostic Schools===
*The [[Mandate]] is a School founded by the sorcerer [[Seswatha]] after the First Apocalypse to fight against the return of the [[No-God]]. Members of the Mandate undergo a ritual that allows them to relive Seswatha's experiences each night whenever they dream, so that they never forget the horrors of what they fight against. Alone in the Three Seas, it still uses the ancient Gnostic magic. The Quorum is the ruling body of the Mandate, which is currently headed by Nautzera.
*The [[Mangaecca]] was an ancient School, founded in the High North. They were the first to come in contact with the alien [[Inchoroi]], leading them to adopt the Inchoroi's evil ways and their powerful non-magical science, the [[Tekne]] (which is essentially [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering genetic engineering]). Their current Grandmaster is [[Shaeönanra]] and they are now a part of the sinister [[Consult]].
* The [[Mihtrûl]] was an ancient School. It was destroyed during the Apocalypse.
* The [[Sohonc]] was an ancient School. It was destroyed during the Apocalypse. Its last Grandmaster was Seswatha, who went on to found the Mandate.
*The [[Swayal Compact]] was founded following the foundation of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]'s New Empire. It is unique for being the only school of sorceresses. Its Grandmistress is [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]] .

===Anagogic Schools===
*The [[Scarlet Spires]] is the largest School on the continent of Eärwa. Its sorcerers are the ''de facto'' rulers of High Ainon, a large southeastern nation, and the only School so powerful its has its own military. Power-hungry and ambitious, it has attempted to steal the secrets of Gnostic magic from the Mandate. [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]], the greatest Grandmaster of the Scarlet Spires, was one of the most powerful men in all Eärwa. During the second trilogy, [[Heramari Iyokus]] has become the Grandmaster.
*The [[Imperial Saik]] is a School from the [[Nansur Empire]] and indentured to the Emperor of Nansur. The School prides itself on loyally serving the interests of the Empire for a thousand years to this day. [[Cememketri]] was their Grandmaster in the last days of the Empire.
*The [[Mysunsai]] is a self-proclaimed "Mercenary School". Its name means "Bond of Three" in Vaparsi. Instead of serving any ruler or nation, it sells its services to any who will purchase them.
*The [[Vokalati]] is a School from the large southern nation of [[Nilnamesh]]. Its name means "sun-wailers" in Vaparsi. They have constantly attempted to steal the Gnosis in the past. By the time of the second trilogy, [[Carindûsû]] is their Grandmaster.
*The Circle of Nibel is mentioned once in Prince of Nothing as a major school, but nothing else is known of this school. Possibly, it's another name for the Vokalati.

===Others===
*The [[Cishaurim]] are the blind sorcerer-priests of the Fanim. Their magic, the [[Psûkhe]], relies on emotion and is completely different from both Gnostic and Anagogic types, as it cannot be perceived by the Few. This seemingly indicates that the magic is in accord with their God's wishes, as sorcery is usually identified by the stain it leaves on reality. The leader of the Cishaurim, known as the High Heresiarch, is [[Seökti]].
* The [[Mbimayu]] are the primary sorcerous school of distant [[Zeüm]]. The Mbimayu serve the [[Satakhan]] in the same manner the Imperial Saik served the old Nansur and Cenei Emperors. The Mbimayu make use of the form of sorcery known as the [[Iswazi]].

=='''Men'''==
With the possible exception of the Sranc, the dominant race of [[Nations|Eärwa]].&lt;ref&gt;"Men" p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;


===&lt;u&gt;'''Emwama'''&lt;/u&gt;===
The indigenous Men of Eärwa, who were slaves of the Nonmen for millennia. They were, along with their surviving inhuman masters, massacred by the invading Five Tribes of Men following the [[Timeline#The_Second_Age|Breaking of the Gates]]. The Emwama spoke a tongue related to Thoti-Eännorean, the ancient root language of all Men. Other than this, very little is known of them. &lt;ref&gt;"Emwama" p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;


===&lt;u&gt;'''The Five Tribes of Men'''&lt;/u&gt;===
The five broader cultural and racial groups that migrated into the Eärwan subcontinent at the beginning of the [[Timeline#The_Second_Age|Second Age]]. These are commonly known as the Norsirai, the Ketyai, the Satyothi, the Scylvendi, and the Xiuhianni. &lt;ref&gt;" Five Tribes of Men" p.441&lt;/ref&gt;
The current human population of Eärwa descends from these five and interbreeding between them.
===='''Norsirai ''' ====

*The typically blond-haired, light-eyed, fair-skinned race predominantly concentrated in the northern Three Seas. Their language group is known as Vasnosri. Although they mostly live on the northern fringes of the Three Seas, they were once the dominant race of Men and ruled all the lands north to the Yimaleti Mountains. &lt;ref&gt;"Norsirai" p.473&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''Ketyai '''====

*The typically dark-haired, brown-eyed, olive-skinned race predominantly concentrated in the southern, western, and eastern Three Seas. Their language group is known as Kenqetic. The Ketyai are the largest race of Men and currently the dominant civilization.  &lt;ref&gt;“Ketyai” p.459&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''Satyothi '''====

*The black-skinned, black-haired but green-eyed race predominantly concentrated in the southwestern nation of Zeüm and the southern extremities of the Three Seas. &lt;ref&gt;“Satyothi” p.481&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''Scylvendi '''====

*The dark-haired, pale-eyed, and fair-skinned race predominantly concentrated in the Jiünati Steppe.  Their language group is known as Skaaric. The Scylvendi are pastoral nomads and very isolated from the other human cultures.&lt;ref&gt;“Scylvendi” p.483&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''Xiuhianni '''====

*The black-haired, olive-skinned race that still dwells beyond the [[Great Kayarsus]], who, according to The Chronicle of the Tusk, refused to follow the other four tribes into Eärwa. Some of the Ketyai on the eastern fringes of the Three Seas have some racial characteristics of Xiuhianni, as they overlap. &lt;ref&gt;“Xiuhianni” p.501&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Nonmen''' &lt;ref&gt;"Nonmen" p.472-473&lt;/ref&gt;==
==='''History'''===

At one time the pre-eminent race of Eärwa, but now much reduced. The Nonmen call themselves ji’cûnû roi, “the People of Dawn,” for reasons they can no longer remember. (They call Men j’ala roi, “the People of Summer,” because they burn so hot and pass so quickly.) The Chronicle of the Tusk, which records the coming of Men to Eärwa, generally refers to Nonmen as Oserukki, the “Not Us.” In the Book of Tribes, the Prophet Angeshraël alternately refers to them as “the Accursed Ones” and “the sodomite Kings of Eärwa,” and he incites the Four Nations of Men to embark on a holy war of extermination. Even after four millennia, this xenocidal mission remains a part of the Inrithi holy canon. According to the Tusk, the Nonmen are anathema:

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; margin-left: 40px;"&gt;''Hearken, for this the God has said, ''&lt;br /&gt;''“These False Men offend Me; ''&lt;br /&gt;''blot out all mark of their Passing.” ''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; margin-left: 40px;"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

==='''Accomplishments'''===

But Cûnuroi civilization was ancient even before these words were carved into the Tusk. While the Halaroi, Men, wandered the world dressed in skins and wielding weapons of stone, the Cûnuroi had invented writing and mathematics, astrology and geometry, sorcery and philosophy. They dredged mountains hollow for the galleries of their High Mansions. They traded and warred with one another. They subdued all Eärwa, enslaving the Emwama, the soft-hearted Men who dwelt in Eärwa in those early days.

==='''Decline'''===

Their decline is the result of three different catastrophic events. The first, and most significant, was the so-called Womb-Plague. In the hope of achieving immortality, the Nonmen (specifically, the great Cu’jara Cinmoi) allowed the Inchoroi to live among them as their physicians. The Nonmen did in fact attain immortality, and the Inchoroi, claiming their work done, retired back to the Incû-Holoinas. The plague struck shortly after, almost killing males and uniformly killing all females. The Nonmen call this tragic event the Nasamorgas, the “Death of Birth.”

==='''Cûno-Inchoroi Wars and Near-Extinction'''===

The following Cûno-Inchoroi Wars further sapped their strength, so that by the time the first Tribes of Men invaded, the Nonmen had not the numbers or, some say, the will to resist their advance. Within the course of a few generations they were nearly exterminated. Only the Mansions of Ishoriöl and Cil-Aujas survived. ''See [[Timeline#C.C3.BBno-Inchoroi_Wars|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].''

=='''Inchoroi'''==
“People of Emptiness” (Ihrimsû). A mysterious and obscene race that, according to legend, descended from the void in the Incû-Holoinas. Very little is known about them, aside from their apparently limitless capacity for cruelty and their malignant obsession with the carnal. ''See [[Timeline#C.C3.BBno-Inchoroi_Wars|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]''. &lt;ref&gt;"Inchoroi" p.452&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ichoroi speak an undeciphered tongue, which the Nonmen call ''Cincûl’hisa'', or “the Gasp of Many Reeds.” According to the ''Isûphiryas'', communication between the Cûnuroi and the Inchoroi was impossible until the latter “birthed mouths” and began speaking Cûnuroi tongues. &lt;ref&gt;"Cincûlic" p.427&lt;/ref&gt;



===&lt;u&gt;'''Sranc'''&lt;/u&gt;''' '''&lt;ref&gt;“Sranc” p.491&lt;/ref&gt;===
===='''Origin '''====

The violent, inhuman creatures first created by the Inchoroi as instruments of war against the Nonmen. According to the Isûphiryas, the Sranc are one of the “Weapon Races” created by the Inchoroi to prosecute their war of extermination against the Nonmen and their Emwama slaves.
===='''Nature '''====

The motivations of the Sranc seem to be as base as imaginable, in that they seem to find sexual gratification in acts of violence. There are innumerable accounts of the indiscriminate rape of men, women, children, and even corpses. They seem to know nothing of mercy or honour, and though they do take prisoners, very few are known to have survived captivity, which is said to be savage beyond imagining.
===='''Physiology '''====

They reproduce rapidly. Though no outward physical differences are readily visible, female Sranc seem to have roles identical to those of male Sranc. Apparently, a great number of Sranc in various stages of pregnancy were observed in battle over the course of the Apocalypse. Though generally inferior to Men in individual combat, they are ideal logistically, as they are able to live for sustained periods on little more than grubs and insects. Survivors recount tales of vast tracts of ground overturned and rooted by passing Sranc hordes. Under the command of the No-God they are utterly fearless, and seem to strike with unerring control and coordination.

===='''Appearance'''====

Typically, Sranc stand no higher than the average caste-menial’s shoulder. Their skin is devoid of pigment, and despite the refined—to the point of repulsiveness—beauty of their faces, their physiognomy is bestial (though hairless), with pinched shoulders and deep, almond-shaped breasts. They are exceedingly fast across both open and broken terrain, and their sheer viciousness is said to compensate for their slight stature.
===='''Threat '''====

Mandate scholars are prone to make dire warnings about the present numbers of Sranc in Eärwa. Apparently the ancient Norsirai had reduced the Sranc, pressing them to the margins of Eärwa, and the No-God was still able to summon hosts that reportedly blackened the horizon. Now Sranc dominate half the continent.


===&lt;u&gt;'''Wracu'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Wracu" p.500&lt;/ref&gt;===
Also known as Dragons. Immense, fire-spitting, winged reptilian monstrosities created by the Inchoroi during the ancient Cûno-Inchoroi Wars to destroy the Nonmen Quya, then subsequently wielded by the No-God during the Apocalypse. Very few are thought to have survived.
=='''Citations'''==
All citations, unless otherwise specifies, are from the "Encyclopedic Glossary" at the end of ''The Thousandfold Thought (Prince of Nothing, Book 3)''

=='''The Nations of The Three Seas'''==
[[File:Earwamap.jpg|thumb|300px|The Continent of Eärwa]]

==='''Eastern Three Seas'''===
*'''[[Conriya]]''' is a [[Ketyai]] nation in the eastern Three Seas. Founded after the collapse of the Eastern [[Ceneian Empire]], it is based around the ancient capital of [[Aoknyssus]]. Nowhere is the caste system more strictly enforced than in Conriya.
*'''[[Galeoth]]''' is a [[Norsirai]] nation on the northern edge of the Three Seas, founded by the descendants of the White Norsirai from the [[Apocalypse]]. Its capital is [[Oswenta]], and its people have a reputation for fractitiousness and treachery.

*'''[[Ce Tydonn]]''' is a Norsirai nation of the Three Seas. It was founded after the collapse of the Ketyai nation of [[Cengemis]], by wandering refugees from the Apocalypse. The Cengemi are now tributary to the Tydonni, a hardened people who view themselves as racially superior to all others.

*'''[[Thunyerus]]''' is a young Norsirai nation of the Three Seas, whose barbarian people are raiders at sea. It was founded through a bond of Thunyeri tribes, and it only recently converted to [[Inrithism]].

*'''High [[Ainon]]''' is the dominant Ketyai nation of the eastern Three Seas. It was founded after the collapse of the Eastern Ceneian Empire and has been ruled by the [[Scarlet Spires]] for near a thousand years. Most populous on the continent, the Ainoni are a highly cultured people.



==='''Western Three Seas'''===
[[File:Threeseas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Western Three Seas; Kian detail]]

*'''The [[Nansur Empire]]''' is a Ketyai nation of the western Three Seas and the inheritor of the enormous Ceneian Empire. At the height of its power, the Nansur Empire extended from Galeoth in the north to [[Nilnamesh]] in the south, but it has been much reduced by centuries of warfare against the [[Fanim]] of Kian.

*'''[[Kian]]''' is the most powerful Ketyai nation of the western Three Seas by far. Alone in the Three Seas, its religion is Fanimry. Extending from the southern frontier of the Nansur Empire all the way to Nilnamesh, Kian was founded relatively recently and expanded through conquest.




=='''The Far West'''==

*'''[[Zeüm]]''' is a large and mysterious nation in the west, far beyond the Three Seas. Its people are black-skinned and little is known of it.

'''Drusas Achamian''' is a former [[Mandate]] Schoolman and spy. Leading up to and during the [[Holy War]] he spied on the [[Scarlet Spires]] and the [[Thousand Temples]]. Following the Holy War’s conquest of [[Shimeh]], and declaration of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] as [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]], he denounced his School, becoming the only [[Wizard]] in the [[Three Seas]].

==Appearance==
Achamian is somewhat rotund and has a long beard with five streaks of grey or white running down its length. He is said to look nothing like one would expect a sorcerer to look. He is around forty-seven when the Holy War begins. &lt;span&gt;At the beginning of [[The Judging Eye (Book)|The]]&lt;/span&gt;[[The Judging Eye (Book)| &lt;span&gt;Judging Eye&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;span&gt;, he has thinned significantly, his hair is balding and his beard is entirely white.&lt;/span&gt;

==Story==
===''What Came Before''===
Achamian was the son of a fisherman. He worked the nets with his father until the Mandate discovered that he was one of the [[Few]] and took him away to receive Mandate training.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Drusas Achamian is sent to [[Sumna]] to investigate [[Maithanet]], whom he fears could be an agent of the [[Consult]]. He resumes an old love affair with a harlot named [[Esmenet]], and recruits his former student, [[Paro Inrau]], to report on Maithanet’s activities.Then Inrau dies under mysterious circumstances. Overcome by guilt and heartbroken by Esmenet’s refusal to cease taking custom, Achamian flees Sumna and travels to [[Momemn]], where the [[Holy War]] gathers.

When he reaches the encampment, Achamian joins the fire of [[Krijates Xinemus]], who agreed to take him to see another old student of his, Prince [[Nersei Proyas]] of [[Conriya]]. Achamian implores him to write Maithanet regarding the circumstances of Inrau’s death, but he leaves thinking that his request will go unfulfilled.

[[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] arrives. Achamian questions the man, only to find himself utterly disarmed by his humour, honesty, and intellect. He becomes Kellhus’s teacher.

Achamian is summoned by [[Ikurei Conphas]] to the Imperial Palace to assess a highly placed adviser of his for the [[Mark]] of sorcery. The Emperor himself demands to know whether the old man bears the blasphemous taint of sorcery. Achamian sees nothing amiss. [[Skeaös]], however, sees something in Achamian. He begins writhing against his chains, speaking a tongue from Achamian’s ancient dreams. Impossibly, the old man breaks free, killing several before being burned by the Emperor’s sorcerers. Dumbfounded, Achamian confronts the howling Skeaös, only to watch horrified as his face peels apart and opens into scorched limbs … The abomination before him, he realizes, is a Consult spy, one that can mimic and replace others without bearing sorcery’s telltale Mark. A [[skin-spy]]. Achamian flees the palace and wanders back to Xinemus’s camp, so absorbed by his horror that he fails to see or hear Esmenet, who has come to rejoin him at long last.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
Achamian is lured to the [[Sareötic Library]], where he is ambushed by the [[Scarlet Spires]]. Though he is able to kill two of his attackers, he is captured. On the orders of [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]], [[Heramari Iyokus]] tries to torture Achamian for information, despite the traditional ineffectivity of torture on Mandate sorcerers (due to the imprint of [[Seswatha]] within their minds). Krijates Xinemus attempts to rescue Achamian, but becomes captured as well. Iyokus blinds Xinemus and plies him with the [[Cants of Compulsion]] in an attempt to break Achamian, but fails. Achamian is able to escape confinement by using a [[Wathi Doll]] to break the [[Uroborian Circle]] imprisoning him. He kills the [[Javreh]] sent to execute him, [[Mamaradda]], and numerous other Javreh and sorcerers in the area. Iyokus summons a [[Ciphrang]], [[Ankaryotis]], which Achamian defeats as well.

Achamian and Xinemus travel to [[Caraskand]] aboard [[Meümaras]]’s ship ''[[Amortanea]].'' When he arrives, he finds that Kellhus has been hung from a circumfix as a false prophet and that Esmenet has become Kellhus’s lover. Though filled with hatred at Kellhus for taking Esmenet from him, Achamian saves him when he reveals that he can identify Consult skin-spies.

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
Kellhus leads the Holy War to a decisive victory in the [http://princeofnothing.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Caraskand Battle of Caraskand], smashing the Kianene forces and killing the [[Padirajah]] himself. Achamian follows his pupil, now at the head of the Holy War, towards Shimeh.

While The Battle of Shimeh, rages, Achamian does battle with a [[Ciphrang]], [[Zioz]]. Victorious, Achamian arrives in Shimeh to witness his former pupil declared [[Aspect-Emperor]] of the Three Seas. In front of an audience of all the great lords of the Inrithi and the Grandmaster of the Mandate, Achamian asks Esmenet to leave Kellhus and become his wife, to which Esmenet refuses. Enraged at his pupil's theft of his love, Achamian denounces Kellhus and his school. In parting, Kellhus ominously tells his him that, should he ever come before Kellhus again, he will kneel before him.

===''The Judging Eye''===
Achamian, now a wizard, lives in exile. He has published a secret history of the Holy War, in which he claims the Aspect-Emperor Anasurimbor Kellhus is a fraud, and a Dûnyain, who has manipulated the hearts of his followers as an adult lording over children. His secret history is censored throughout most of the Three Seas but has gained a following in [[Zeüm|Zeum]], the last great hold-out against the power of the Aspect-Emperor among men.

After leaving the Mandate, Achamian's dreams began to change, giving him insights into secrets about Seswatha's life. In dreams, he learns of [[Ishuäl|Ishual]] and that its location can be found on a map in the Library of [[Sauglish]]. He recruits a [[scalpoi]] company called the [[Skin Eaters]] to accompany him to Sauglish under the false pretense that there are riches in the library's [[Coffers]].

Meanwhile, [[Mimara]] has located Achamian believing that he is her father and demands that he teach her the Gnosis. He does not believe that she is his daughter and refuses. She persists, and they sleep together. After he leaves for Sauglish, she secretly follows. When the Skin Eaters discover her, Achamian allows her to accompany them.

In order to catch up to the Great Ordeal, Achamian, Mimara and the Skin Eaters enter the ancient Nonmen mansion of Cil-Aujas. There they found the mansion overrun by Sranc and Bashrag. Only by the combined might of Achamian, Cleric and the skilled Skin Eaters did they manage to pass through the mansion, out to the Osthwai Mountains' other side.

Achamian confides to Mimara that he believes she has the [[Judging Eye]], and hopes to have her judge her adoptive father Anasurimbor Kellhus.

'''Esmenet''' was a whore from [[Sumna]], and a friend and lover of [[Drusas Achamian]]. She marries [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] and becomes Empress of [[Three Seas]].

==Appearance==

Esmenet has dark hair and brown eyes. She has two snake heads tattooed to the back of her left hand, marking her as a prostitute in Sumna. She is considered very attractive.

==Story==

===''What Came Before''===
Esmenet has always regretted being unable to see the world outside Sumna. She asks her clients to tell her their stories so she can travel the world vicariously. Achamian's reaction to her questions endeared him to her, and he became a regular client whenever he was in Sumna.

Esmenet had a daughter, [[Mimara]], while she was still a young prostitute. During a severe famine, she sold her daughter to slavers to buy food. She would later deeply regret the decision and claim that her daughter died.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

When [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] arrives on his mission to learn more about [[Maithanet]], she readily takes him in and participates in his plotting sessions. When his informant, [[Paro Inrau|Inrau]], is murdered, the Schoolman is forced to travel to [[Momemn]]. Esmenet begs him to take her with him, but he refuses.

Not long after, a [[Aurang|threatening stranger]] comes to her room, demanding to know everything about Achamian. The man ravishes her using an inexplicable ability to provide intense pleasure with his touch. Esmenet finds herself answering all his questions before he vanishes leaving only pools of black seed to mark his passing.

Esmenet flees [[Sumna]], determined to find Achamian and tell him what happened. On her way to Momemn she pauses in a village, hoping to find someone to repair her broken sandal. When the villagers recognize the whore’s tattoo on her hand they begin stoning her. Only the sudden appearance of [[Cutias Sarcellus|Sarcellus]] saves her. Sarcellus takes her to Momemn.

Once they reach the [[Holy War]], Esmenet stays with Sarcellus. Until one night before the Holy War is to march, she sets off in search of the Achamian, determined to tell him everything that has happened. She locates [[Krijates Xinemus|Xinemus]]’s camp. Ashamed, she hides in the darkness, waiting for Achamian to appear. When she sees him trudging toward her. She holds out her arms to him, weeping with joy and sorrow … And he simply walks past her as though she were a stranger. Heartbroken, she flees, determined to make her own way in the Holy War.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===

Thinking [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] has repudiated her, Esmenet joins a troop of camp prostitutes. At [[Asgilioch]], she finds Achamian kneeling in the crowds, drunk and beaten. They reconcile, even though she cannot confess the truth of her affair with [[Cutias Sarcellus|Sarcellus]]. She joins him in his humble tent, and becomes his wife in spirit if not in ritual. Achamian introduces her to [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] and [[Serwë]].

When Achamian goes missing. She mourns him the way she once mourned her dead daughter. While the Men of the Tusk assail the South Bank, she remains alone in Achamian’s tent, refusing to rejoin the Holy War.

After the [[Battle of Anwurat]], Kellhus comes to her with Serwë, and convinces her to join them on the continued march. He begins teaching her how to read and she finds herself attracted to Kellhus. She confesses the truth about her daughter: [[Mimara]] didn’t die all those years ago. Esmenet sold the girl to slavers to forestall starvation. She and Kellhus make love the following morning and she becomes his second wife. She becomes pregnant.

When the Great Names execute Serwë and condemn Kellhus to the Circumfix. All seems lost … Until Achamian returns.

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===

===''The Judging Eye''===

In [[Momemn]], the capital of the New Empire, Esmenet struggles to rule in her husband's absence. The Imperial Court regards her with condescension. She has the travails of her own family to contend with: all her eldest children have gone. [[Mimara]] has fled to [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]]. [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayûtas]], [[Anasûrimbor Serwa|Serwa]], and her stepson, [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II|Moënghus]], ride with their father in the Great Ordeal. [[Anasûrimbor Theliopa|Theliopa]] remains with her as an adviser, but she is scarcely human. The next youngest, the mad and murderous [[Anasûrimbor Inrilatas|Inrilatas]], Esmenet keeps imprisoned atop the [[Andiamine Heights]]. Only her very youngest, [[Kelmomas]], who murders his twin brother [[Samarmas|Samarmas,]] provides her with any comfort.

At [[Maithanet]]'s bidding, Esmenet summons Sharacinth, the officially sanctioned Matriarch of the [[The Cult of Yatwer|Yatwerians]], with the intention of setting the Cult against itself. When they fail to cow the woman, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] himself arrives and breaks her will to resist with sheer force of presence. The blubbering Matriarch yields, promising to wrest her Cult from [[Psatma Nannaferi]].

Kelmomas murders Sharacinth and her retinue. Rumours of her assassination travel quickly, igniting the embers of sedition among the slaves and caste-menials. Riots erupt across the New Empire. Esmenet turns to Kelmomas for comfort. Intoxicated with success, he begins plotting against his uncle, Maithanet, knowing that the man alone possesses the ability to see through his deception.

'''Qûya''' are the [[Nonmen]] magi.

Because Nonmen continue to refine their [[sorcery]] over thousands of years, they tend to far exceed human sorcerers in power. Their [[Mark]]s are also correspondingly deeper.

Qûya were instrumental to the Nonmen’s victory over the [[Inchoroi]] at the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]] during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]. The Inchoroi subsequently had the [[Chorae]] created to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''R. Scott Bakker''' (born 2 February 1967 in Simcoe, Ontario) is a Canadian author of fantasy and science fiction. He grew up on a tobacco farm in the Simcoe area. He attended the University of Western Ontario and attained a degree in Literature and later an MA in Theory and Criticism. He currently lives in London, Ontario with his wife and daughter.

==Works==
R. Scott Bakker’s work is dominated by a sprawling series informally known as '''''[[The Second Apocalypse]]''''' which he began developing while in college in the 1980s. The series was originally planned to be a trilogy with the first two books entitled ''[[The Prince of Nothing]]'' and ''[[Aspect-Emperor|The Aspect-Emperor]]''. The third book has been referred to as ''The Book That Shall Not Be Named'' by Bakker, since the title of this book is considered to be a spoiler for the preceding volumes.

When Bakker began writing the series in the early 2000s, however, he found it necessary to split each of the three novels into its own sub-series to incorporate all of the characters, themes and ideas he wished to explore. Bakker originally conceived of seven books, a trilogy and two duologies. This later shifted to two trilogies and one duology, with the acknowledgment that the third series may also expand to a trilogy.

His first novel, ''[[The Darkness That Comes Before]]'', the first novel in the ''Prince of Nothing'' trilogy, was published in 2003. This was followed by ''[[The Warrior-Prophet]]'' and ''[[The Thousandfold Thought (Book)|The Thousandfold Thought]]'' in 2004 and 2006 respectively, rounding off the initial trilogy.

While working on ''The Prince of Nothing'' series, Bakker was given a challenge by his wife to write a thriller. In response he produced a science fiction suspense novel involving a serial killer who can influence and control the human mind. This book is called ''[[Neuropath]]'' and was published in 2008. Bakker then returned to [[Eärwa]] with ''[[The Judging Eye (Book)|The Judging Eye]]'', the first book in the ''Aspect-Emperor'' trilogy, published in 2009. He followed this up with ''[[The White-Luck Warrior (Book)|The White-Luck Warrior]]'' in 2011. He hopes to publish the final book in the second trilogy, ''[[The Unholy Consult]]'', in 2015. This will be followed by a third and final series (either a trilogy or duology), the title for which has not been revealed yet. Bakker is also working on an unrelated series of detective thrillers, [[The Disciple Manning Series]], the first of which, ''[[Disciple of the Dog]]'', was published in 2010.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16853">'''Sorcery''' in the world of [[Eärwa]] is the use of language to forcibly influence reality. Or put another way, it is the practice of making the world conform to language, as opposed to philosophy, the practice of making language conform to the world.{{EG|Sorcery}}

==The Structure of Sorcery==
Despite a tremendous amount of unresolvable controversy surrounding sorcery, there are several salient features that seem universal to its practice:
*Practitioners must be able to apprehend the [[onta]], the very fabric of existence,{{EG|onta}} which is to say, they must possess the innate ability to see “Creation ''as created.''”{{EG|Sorcery}}
*Sorcery requires precise meanings. This is why incantations are always spoken in a non-native tongue: to prevent the semantic transformation of crucial terms due to the vagaries of daily usage.{{EG|Sorcery}}
*All sorcerous incantations require the sorcerer to say and think two separate things simultaneously. The spoken segment of an incantation (what is often called the “utteral string”) must have its meaning “fixed” or focused with a silent segment (what is often called the “inutteral string”) that is simultaneously thought. The thought incantation sharpens the meaning of the spoken incantation the way the words of one person may be used to clarify the words of another.{{EG|Sorcery}}

There are many metaphysical interpretations of this structure, but the result in each case is the same: the world, which is otherwise utterly indifferent to the words of Men, ''listens'', and sorcerous transformations of reality result.{{EG|Sorcery}}

==Words and Meaning==
Although words are the tools through which sorcery is implemented, the words themselves do not hold meaning, rather, words are the tools through which meaning is ''conveyed''. And since even simple words can have multiple meanings based on a variety of circumstances, sorcerers aim to find the most perfect meaning of a word, the meaning that transcends all connotation.

{{Blockquote|Preserving and expressing the pure modalities of meaning,” he continued, “this is the heart of all sorcery... With each word, you must strike the perfect semantic pitch, the note that will drown out the chorus of reality.|Drusas Achamian.{{3|6}}}}

Thus, to protect pure meaning from the inconsistencies of experience, sorcerers of all schools use an ancient language, a lingua arcana, to form their Cants.

{{Blockquote|Vulgar languages [...] are too easily warped by our insights and experiences. The sheer otherness of [[Languages of Eärwa|Gilcûnya]] serves to insulate the semantics of sorcery from the inconstancies of our lives.|Drusas Achamian.{{3|6}}}}

===The origin of Meaning===
Words are given meaning from memory, the meaning of a word differs between sorcerers because what the word recollects is different. Sorcerous languages seek to grasp the conceptually perfect ideal of a word, the ''perfect meaning''.{{3|10}}

According to [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], perfect meaning comes from the memory of perfection.

{{Blockquote|To speak sorcery, Akka, is to speak words that recollect the Truth.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus.{{3|10}}}}

==The Few==
The Few are those born with the innate ability to sense the onta and work sorcery.{{EG|Few, the}} The Few are able to look beyond the appearance of things, beyond the reality of things, into the ideal. Men, who have forgotten God's voice, can only see one angle of reality.

{{Blockquote|But the Few—those who recollect, no matter how imperfectly, the God’s voice—possess an intimation of many angles, a memory of the thousand eyes that look out from this clearing we call ‘here.’ As a result everything they see is transformed, shadowed by insinuations of more.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus.{{3|10}}}}

According to Anasûrimbor Kellhus’s ''[[Novum Arcanum]]'', the God peers through all eyes, and the Few were those whose sight recollected something of His all-seeing gaze and so could speak with the timbre of His all-creating voice.{{4|16}}

==The Mark==
The Mark is the name for what is otherwise known as the “bruising of the onta.” Aside from the [[Psûkhe]], which may or may not be a true sorcery, all sorcerous manifestations and practitioners exhibit what is called the Mark. Various descriptions of the Mark have come down through history, but there seems to be little consistency in the accounts, apart from the experience’s ephemeral nature.

According to religious accounts, the Mark is akin to the disfiguring of criminals, the way the God reveals the blasphemers in the presence of the righteous. But apologists such as [[Zarathinius]] point out that if this is indeed the case, then it is more than a little ironic that only the blasphemers can see the Mark.

In secular accounts, textual analogies are typically resorted to: seeing the Mark is akin to seeing where text has been scratched away and overwritten in ancient documents. In the case of sorcery, since the amendments to reality are as flawed as the Men who do the amending, it stands to reason that some essential difference would be visible.{{EG|Mark, the}}

==The branches of Sorcery==
===Gnosis===
The branch of sorcery once practised by the Gnostic Schools of the [[Ancient North]] but now known only to the Schools of [[Mandate]] and [[Mangaecca]]. Unlike [[Anagogis|Anagogic]] sorcery, Gnostic sorcery is leveraged through the use of the Abstractions, which is why Gnostic sorcerers are often referred to as Philosopher Magi. The Gnosis was first developed by the [[Nonmen]] [[Qûya]], who imparted it to the early [[Norsirai]] Anagogic sorcerers during the [[Nonman Tutelage]], 555-825.{{EG|Gnosis}}

Gilcûnya is the tongue of the Nonmen Qûya and the Gnostic Schools.{{EG|Gilcûnya}}

Some common Gnostic Cants include, the Bar of Heaven, the Bisecting Planes of Mirseor, the Cirroi Loom, the Ellipses of Thosolankis, the Odaini Concussion Cant, the Seventh Quyan Theorem, and the Weära Comb.{{EG|Gnosis}}
*The War-Cants are the Gnostic sorceries developed in [[Sauglish]] (primarily by [[Noshainrau]] the White) for the express purpose of waging war and overcoming opposing sorcerers.{{EG|War-Cants}}
*The denotaries are the “primer” Cants given to students to practice “dividing their voice,” which is to say, saying and thinking two separate things.{{EG|denatories}}
*The Agonies are the Gnostic Cants of Torment, a reputed specialty of the [[Mangaecca]].{{EG|Agonies}}

With the exception of Metagnostic Cants, Gnostic Cants require a Sorcerer to use one utteral and one inutteral simultaneously. With Metagnostic Cants an utteral is combined with two inutterals. The only Metagnostic Cant known is the Cant of Translocation, also called the Cant of Transposition.{{3|16}}

“Gnosis” comes from the ancient Greek word “Γνώσης,” meaning “Knowledge.”

===Anagogis===
The branch of sorcery that turns on the resonance between meanings and concrete things.{{EG|Anagogis}} It uses creative metaphors to implement sorcery. The Anagogis is generally considered inferior to the Gnosis because it works through Analogies as opposed to Abstractions: the Anagogic sorcerers can summon only an imitation of a dragon which spews out fire, while Gnostic sorcerers can summon heat itself.{{EG|Anagogis}}

High Kunna is the debased version of Gilcûnya used by the Anagogic Schools of the [[Three Seas]].{{EG|High Kunna}}

“Anagogis” comes from the Greek word “Αναγωγής,” meaning “Comparison.”

===Aporos===
The branch of sorcery once studied by Nonmen Qûya. Forbidden from practicing their art under [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], the practitioners of the Aporos were seduced by the [[Inchoroi]], whose loss of the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]] had been largely due to the power of Qûya. They created for their masters the first of the [[Chorae]], which rendered their bearers immune to magic and killed Qûya on touch.{{EG|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars}}

“Aporos” comes from the Greek word “Άπορος,” meaning “Destitute.”

===Daimos===
Also known as noömancy. The sorcery of summoning and enslaving agencies, such as [[Ciphrang]], from the [[Outside]]. The Daimos is not a true branch of Sorcery, as it can be implemented using either the Gnosis or the Anagogis. For both political and pragmatic reasons, many Schools forbid its practice. Some esoteric scholars claim that Daimotic sorcerers condemn themselves to eternal torment at the hands of their erstwhile slaves when they die.{{EG|Daimos}}

“Daimos” comes from the Greek word “Δαιμος,” meaning “Demons.”

==Wards and Cants==
Wards is the name given to defensive sorceries in contradistinction to offensive sorceries, known as Cants.{{EG|Wards}}

The most common types of Wards (found in both Anagogic and Gnostic sorceries) are:
* '''Wards of Exposure''', which provide advance warning of intruders or imminent attacks.
* '''Shield-Wards''', which provide direct protection against offensive sorceries.
* '''Skin-Wards''', which provide “protection of last resort” against all types of threat.

Cants is the name given to offensive sorcerous incantations.{{EG|Cants}} Two common types are:
* '''Cants of Calling''', the family of incantations that enable communications over distance. Though the metaphysics of these Cants is only loosely understood, all long-distance Cants of Calling seem to turn on the so-called Here Hypothesis. One can call only to slumbering souls (because they remain open to the Outside) and only to those residing someplace where the Caller has physically been. The idea is that the “Here” of the Caller can only reach a “There,” or other location, that has been a “Here” sometime in the past. The degree of similarity between Anagogic and Gnostic Cants of Calling has led many to suspect that they hold the key to unravelling the Gnosis.{{EG|Cants of Calling}}
* '''Cants of Compulsion''', the family of incantations that control the movements of an individual’s soul. Typically these include the so-called Cants of Torment, though not always. An insidious aspect of these Cants is that their subject often has no way of distinguishing sorcerously compelled thoughts from his own thoughts. This has spawned a whole literature on the very notion of “will.” If the compelled soul feels every bit as uncompelled as the free soul, then how can anyone truly know himself to be free?{{EG|Cants of Compulsion}}

==The Schools of Sorcery==
Since Sorcery is unnatural, destructive and poses a great danger, it is viewed as a terrible blasphemy by the [[Thousand Temples]] and is widely condemned by faithful [[Inrithism|Inrithi]]. Sorcerous Schools arose in response to this pressure, creating powerful political forces apart from the oppressive religious order.{{EG|Schools}}

The so-called “Major Schools” of the Three Seas are the Circle of Nibel, the [[Imperial Saik]], the School of [[Mandate]], the [[Mysunsai]], and the [[Scarlet Spires]]. The Schools are among the oldest institutions in the Three Seas, surviving, by and large, both because of the terror they inspire and by their detachment from the secular and religious powers of the Three Seas. With the exception of the Mysunsai, all the Major Schools predate the fall of the [[Ceneian Empire]].{{EG|Schools}}

Untill the proclamation of Anasûrimbor Kellhus as Aspect-Emperor of the Three Seas, the Schools only allowed male practitioners, further dwindling the number of possible sorcerers, however, since then the [[Swayal Compact]] was created as the first School for sorceresses in Eärwa.

===Gnostic Schools===
Only two Gnostic Schools, the Mangaecca and the Mandate, survive, though prior to the [[First Apocalypse]] some dozen or so Gnostic Schools were in existence, the Sohonc foremost among them.{{EG|Gnostic Schools}}
*The '''Mandate''' is the School founded by [[Seswatha]] to continue the war against the [[Consult]] and to protect the Three Seas from the return of the No-God. Aside from its apocalyptic calling, the Mandate is distinct from the other sorcerous Schools in its possession of the Gnosis, a monopoly it has been able to protect for almost two thousand years. Mandate Schoolmen continuously dream Seswatha’s experiences of the Apocalypse every night, the effect of a sorcerous rite called the Grasping, where initiates reputedly submit to incantations while holding Seswatha’s mummified heart.{{EG|Mandate, School of}}
*The '''Mangaecca''' was the ancient rival to the School of [[Sohonc]], and last of the four original Gnostic Schools. From its founding the School of Mangaecca had pursued a predatory ethos, regarding knowledge as the embodiment of power. In 777, they discovered the [[Incû-Holoinas]], the dread Ark of the Inchoroi. Over the following centuries they continued their excavations of the Ark and their investigations of the [[Tekne]]. In 1123, [[Shaeönanra]], then Grandmaster of the Mangaecca, discovered a catastrophic means to undo the scriptural damnation of sorcerers. The School was promptly outlawed, and the remainder of the School fled to [[Golgotterath]], abandoning [[Sauglish]] forever. By the time of the Apocalypse, they had transformed into what would be called the Consult.{{EG|Mangaecca}}
*The '''Swayal Compact''' was founded following the foundation of Anasûrimbor Kellhus’s [[New Empire]]. It is the only school for sorceresses in Eärwa. Its Grandmistress is [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]].

===Anagogic Schools===
*The '''Scarlet Spires''' is the largest School on the continent of Eärwa. Its sorcerers are the ''de facto'' rulers of High Ainon, a large southeastern nation, and the only School so powerful its has its own military. Power-hungry and ambitious, it has attempted to steal the secrets of Gnostic magic from the Mandate. [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]], the greatest Grandmaster of the Scarlet Spires, was one of the most powerful men in all Eärwa. During the second trilogy, [[Heramari Iyokus]] has become the Grandmaster.{{EG|Scarlet Spires}}
*The '''Imperial Saik''' is a School from the [[Nansur Empire]] and indentured to the Emperor of Nansur. The School prides itself on loyally serving the interests of the Empire for a thousand years to this day. [[Cememketri]] was their Grandmaster in the last days of the Empire.{{EG|Saik}}
*The '''Mysunsai''' is a self-proclaimed "Mercenary School". Its name means "Bond of Three" in Vaparsi. Instead of serving any ruler or nation, it sells its services to any who will purchase them.{{EG|Mysunsai}}
*The '''Vokalati''' is a School from the large southern nation of [[Nilnamesh]]. Its name means "sun-wailers" in Vaparsi. They have constantly attempted to steal the Gnosis in the past. By the time of the second trilogy, [[Carindûsû]] is their Grandmaster.
*The '''Circle of Nibel''' is mentioned once in Prince of Nothing as a major school, but nothing else is known of this school. Possibly, it's another name for the Vokalati.

==Cishaurim and the Psûkhe==
The [[Cishaurim]] are the notorious priest-sorcerers of the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] based in [[Shimeh]]. According to Fanim religious tradition, the Prophet [[Fane]] became the first of the Cishaurim after he went blind in the desert.{{EG|Cishaurim}}

Given Fane’s claim that the true power of the [[Solitary God]] cannot be exercised so long as one sees the profane world, Cishaurim initiates voluntarily blind themselves at a certain point in their study, enabling them to dispense the “divine water” of the “Psûkhe,” as the Cishaurim refer to it.{{EG|Cishaurim}}

{{Blockquote|They douse the fire of their eyes, pluck the one angle they see, to better grasp the many they ''recollect''. They sacrifice the subtle articulations of knowledge for the inchoate profundities of intuition. They recall the tone and timbre, the ''passion'', of the God’s voice—to near perfection—even as the meanings that make up true sorcery escape them.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus.{{3|10}}}}

Little is known about the metaphysics of the Psûkhe beyond the fact that it cannot be perceived by the Few and that it is in many ways almost as formidable as the Anagogic practice of the Schools.{{EG|Cishaurim}}

“Psûkhe” comes from the Greek word “Ψυχή,” meaning “Soul” or “Spirit.”

==Religious views on Sorcery==
Sorcery is viewed as sacrilegious by the Thousand Temples, and is condemned in the Inrithi nations. According to ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', sorcerers are unclean.{{EG|Unclean, the}}

{{Blockquote|Cut from them their tongues, for their blasphemy is an abomination like no other … Burn them, for they are Unclean.|The Chronicle of the Tusk.{{1|2}}{{EG|“Cut from them their tounges …”}}{{2|9}}}}

Thus, sorcerers are generally thought to be damned by the Inrithi.{{1|11}}

The '''''Prince of Nothing''''' is a series of three fantasy novels by the Canadian author [[R. Scott Bakker]], the first book of which was published in 2003, part of a wider series known as ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]''. The trilogy details the emergence of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], a brilliant monastic warrior, as he takes control of a [[Holy War]] and the hearts and minds of its leaders.  Kellhus exhibits incredible powers of prediction and persuasion, which are derived from deep knowledge of rationality, cognitive biases, and causality, as discovered by the [[Dûnyain]], a secret monastic sect. As Kellhus goes from military leader to divine prophet, [[Drusas Achamian]], the sorcerer who mentors Kellhus, comes to realize that his student may well be the harbinger of the prophesied [[Second Apocalypse]].

The key feature distinguishing the ''Prince of Nothing'' series from its contemporaries is the importance of philosophy to the work. The plot, characters, setting, and metaphysics of the ''Prince of Nothing'' are intertwined with philosophical positions unique to the series.

Bakker has mentioned that this series was primarily influenced by the works of Tolkien and Frank Herbert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/features/2005/R-Scott-Bakker-Interview-8186.php R. Scott Bakker Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publisher's summary==
===[[The Darkness That Comes Before]]===
Strikingly original in its conception, ambitious in scope, with characters engrossingly and vividly drawn, the first book in ''R. Scott Bakker’s Prince of Nothing'' series creates a remarkable world from whole cloth—its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals—the kind of all—embracing universe ''Tolkien'' and ''Herbert'' created unforgettably in the epic fantasies ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''Dune.''

It’s a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both two thousand years past and two thousand years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveller, Anasûrimbor Kellhus—part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence—from lands long thought dead.

''The Darkness That Comes Before'' is a history of this great Holy War, and like all histories, the survivours write its conclusion.
===[[The Warrior-Prophet]]===
The first battle against the heathen has been won, but while the Great Names plot and squabble over the spoils, Kellhus patiently extends his influence, drawing more followers to his banner.

The sorcerer Achamian and his lover, Esmenet, submit entirely, only to have their faith tested in unimaginable ways. The warrior Cnaiür falls ever deeper into madness. The skin-spies of the Consult watch with growing trepidation. And as the vast host of the Holy War endures its sternest test in the searing wastes of the desert, a name—a title—begins to be whispered amongst the faithful.

But who is the Warrior-Prophet: a dangerous heretic, who turns brother against brother? Or the only man who can avert the Second Apocalypse? The Holy War stands on a knife edge. If all is not to be lost the great powers will have to choose between their most desperate desires and their most ingrained prejudice. Between hatred and hope. Between the Warrior-Prophet and the end of the world …
===[[The Thousandfold Thought (Book)|The Thousandfold Thought]]===
''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' R. Scott Bakker’s magnificent debut, drew thunderous acclaim from reviewers and fellow fantasy authors. Readers were invited into a darkly threatening, thrillingly imaginative universe as fully realized as that of any in modern fantasy and introduced to one of the genre’s great characters: the powerful warrior-philosopher Anasûrimbor Kellhus, on whom the fate of a violently apocalyptic Holy War rests.

Bakker’s follow up to ''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' ''The Warrior-Prophet'' enticed readers further into the richly imagined world of myth, violence, and sorcery. The startling and far-reaching answers to these questions are brought into thrilling focus in ''The Thousandfold Thought,'' the conclusion to ''The Prince of Nothing'' trilogy.

Casting into question all the action that has taken place before, twisting readers’ intuitions in unforeseen directions, remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, R. Scott Bakker has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the reader with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of fantasy literature.

==Background==
The ''Prince of Nothing'' series takes place in the fictional continent of [[Eärwa]], which is separated from another continent to the east (mentioned but unseen), called [[Eänna]]. The main inhabitants of Eärwa are human, but were preceded by the [[Nonmen]] (or Cûnuroi), immortal beings who went mad with the accumulation of centuries of memory, and the [[Inchoroi]], alien beings who crash-landed in northern Eärwa five-thousand years prior to the events of the ''Prince of Nothing''. These creatures' machinations led both to the downfall of the Nonmen and, with the aid of a group of human sorcerers known as the [[Consult]], the summoning of Mog-Pharau, the [[No-God]]. This event, known as the [[Apocalypse|First Apocalypse]], caused the collapse of most of human civilization, but was stopped by the efforts of the sorcerer [[Seswatha]] and [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], the last of a line of royalty. Society was eventually rebuilt after this event, which became more legend than history. Nonetheless, the Consult still endeavored to bring back the No-God and finish the plan they had begun thousands of years before.

The action of the series is confined to the [[Three Seas]] area, home of multiple human nations, ethnicities, and religions. The first novel opens with the start of a Holy War, pitting the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] nations and the [[Thousand Temples]] against the "heathen" [[Fanimry|Fanim]], followers of a prophet who broke from Inrithism hundreds of years previously. The goal of the war is to retake [[Shimeh]], a city venerated by both faiths, although as the war progresses its goal is subtly warped from the inside by the machinations of Anasûrimbor Kellhus.

[[File:Warrior-prophet.jpg|right|300px]]
==Main Characters==
The novels follow the point of view of several characters on the Inrithi side of the Holy War. Most of the characters are of the [[Ketyai]] ethnicity, common to the western and eastern Three Seas. Characters' surnames precede their given names, similar to the order commonly used in Hungary, China, and Japan.

*'''Drusas Achamian''' is a member of the [[Mandate]] [[School]], who joins the Holy War by order of his superiors. There, he meets and teaches Anasûrimbor Kellhus in secret, while slowly discovering his place in the coming Second Apocalypse. Achamian also meets his old students [[Nersei Proyas]], Prince of [[Conriya]], and [[Krijates Xinemus]], the Marshal of [[Attrempus]].

*'''[[Esmenet]]''' is a prostitute in the city of [[Sumna]], and is Achamian's lover. She follows him into the Holy War and falls under the influence of Kellhus along with Achamian.

*'''Anasûrimbor Kellhus''' is the mysterious Dûnyain monk whose power over those around him brings him control of the Holy War and its people. He was sent by his sect to find his father, [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]], who lives in the city of Shimeh, the Holy War's destination.

*'''[[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]]''' is a [[Scylvendi]] barbarian chieftain of the [[Utemot]] tribe, whose relationship with Moënghus 30 years previously makes him the only character with knowledge of the Dûnyain. He is also the first to meet Kellhus, and accompanies him to [[Momemn]] to join the Holy War.

*'''[[Serwë]]''' is a concubine claimed by Cnaiür as his prize, and later used by Kellhus to control Cnaiür.

*'''[[Ikurei Conphas]]''' is a prideful [[Nansur]] general and nephew to that nation's Emperor. His victories over the Scylvendi make him the foremost choice for leader of the Holy War, before Cnaiür takes that position from him.

*'''Anasûrimbor Moënghus''' is Kellhus' father. He left the Dûnyain 30 years before the events of the series.

==Magic and the Schools==
Magic in the ''Prince of Nothing'' is the use of the spell-caster's will to influence the world, often contrary to the plans of the [[gods]]. Thus, magic is viewed as sacrilegious by the Thousand Temples, and is condemned in the Inrithi nations. Sorcerous Schools arose in response to this pressure, creating powerful political and military forces apart from the religious order.

The human population of Eärwa is not all able to use magic. Rather, that ability is confined to the [[Few]], a small subset of people. Additionally, the various Schools of magic only allow male practitioners, further dwindling the number of possible sorcerers. Even so, those who choose to study magic are granted large amounts of power, balanced by a lack of religious acceptance and a vulnerability to [[Chorae]], small spherical antimagic talismans.

There are two main types of magic used in the northern Three Seas: [[Gnosis|Gnostic]] and [[Anagogis|Anagogic]]. While Gnostic magic is superios, it is largely forgotten (being the dominant art of the [[Ancient North]], destroyed during the First Apocalypse). Anagogic magic is more widely studied among multiple schools.

===Gnostic Schools===
*The '''Mandate''' is a School founded by Seswatha after the First Apocalypse to fight against the return of Mog-Pharau. Members of the Mandate undergo a ritual that allows them to relive Seswatha's experiences each night as they dream, so that they never forget the horrors of the Apocalypse. The Quorum is the ruling body of the Mandate School, which is headed by [[Seidru Nautzera]].

*The '''[[Mangaecca]]''', or the '''Consult''' (as it was later known), is the School that first came in contact with the Inchoroi, leading them to adopt those beings' immoral ways, along with the powerful art of [[Tekne]] (essentially genetic engineering).

===Anagogic Schools===
*The '''[[Scarlet Spires]]''' is the most powerful School in the Three Seas. It controls much of the politics of [[High Ainon]], an eastern Ketyai nation. It has has attempted to steal the secrets of Gnosis from the Mandate, using kidnapping and torture, but without success. [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]] is the Grandmaster of the Scarlet Spires during the series.

*The '''[[Imperial Saik]]''' is a School indentured to the Emperor of Nansur, and serves the interests of the Nansur Empire, which has been most directly in conflict with the [[Kian|Kianene]] Fanim. [[Cememketri]] is the Grandmaster of this school.

*The '''[[Mysunsai]]''' is the self-proclaimed "Mercenary School". Instead of serving some political power, it sells its services to any who will purchase its service.

===Other types===
*The '''[[Psûkhe]]''' is the arcane art of the [[Cishaurim]], the blind sorcerer-priests of the Fanim. Their magic is seemingly separate from the Gnostic and Anagogic types, as it cannot be perceived by the Few. This seemingly indicates that the magic is in accord with the gods' (or in the case of the Fanim, God's) wishes, as sorcery is usually identified by the harmful [[Mark]] it makes upon Creation.

*The '''[[Daimos]]''' is magic used to summon creatures from the Outside, such as the demonic [[Ciphrang]], by binding those beings to the caster's soul. [[Heramari Iyokus]], Master of Spies of the Scarlet Spires, is the only Daimotic caster introduced in the series.

[[File:The_Thousandfold_Thought_US_hardcover.jpg|left|300px]]
==Religion==
Religion plays an important part in the politics and daily life of the residents of the Three Seas. The Holy War, the driving force behind the plot of the ''Prince of Nothing'', is an explicitly religious conflict between the Inrithi and the Fanim, the two main religious orders of the region.

===Inrithism===
The Inrithi religion was founded on the revelation of the Latter Prophet, [[Inri Sejenus]]. Analogous to Christianity (INRI is an acronym found on many crucifixes, while "Sejenus" is an anagram of n e Jesus, phonetically Any Jesus), this religion is a mixture of polytheistic and monotheistic elements. The polytheistic portion is derived from the ancient Cults, which are devoted each to a different god. The central text of Inrithism is ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', an enormous carved tusk covered in the writings of the early prophets before the [[Five Tribes of Men]] entered into Earwa. Inri Sejenus  provided a reinterpretation of the tusk, fusing the individual gods of the Cults into Aspects of one God.

The Thousand Temples are the ecclesiastical body that represents Inrithism, which is headed by the [[Shriah]], a parallel figure to the Catholic Church's Pope. The Shriah is also in charge of the [[Shrial Knights]], a monastic military order which are analogous to the religious Praetorian Guard. The Thousand Temples are based in Sumna, where the Holy War begins.

At the start of the series, [[Maithanet]] is the Shriah, and [[Incheiri Gotian]] is the Grandmaster of the Shrial Knights.

===The Zaudunyani===
During ''The Warrior Prophet'' and ''The Thousandfold Thought'', Kellhus creates a branch of Inrithism based around his own actions and prophecy. Its symbol is the Circumfix, the apparatus used to torture Kellhus (an obvious parallel to the crucifix). The name comes from the fact that adherents are part of Kellhus' "tribe of truth", and followers of the Dûnyain teachings.

===Fanimry===
Based on the teachings of the Prophet [[Fane]], Fanimry is solely monotheistic and rejects the polytheistic elements of Inrithism, as well as the holiness of the Tusk. This puts it in direct conflict with the Thousand Temples. The only nation of the Three Seas that accepts Fanimry is Kian, in the southwest of the region. Additionally, Fanimry disagrees on the acceptance of magic and sorcerers—in this case the Psûkhe, the magic cast by the Cishaurim.

The Fanim appear analogous to Muslims, as they are desert-dwelling monotheists in conflict with an older related faith. Bakker also uses Islamic terms when describing the Fanim, such as their "[[White Jihad]]", a war against the Nansur Empire to the north of Kian. Also, Fanimry has a prohibition against representations of the God, akin to hadith prohibitions against depictions of Muhammad and other rules against idolatry.

==Historical influences==
R. Scott Bakker drew upon many cultures &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sffworld.com/interview/7p0.html Interview with R. Scott Bakker (2004-07-18)]&lt;/ref&gt; as inspiration—notably Hellenistic Greece, Scythia, the Byzantine Empire, and other European and Middle Eastern cultures—for the Three Seas region of Eärwa.

The setting is large and sweeping, with obvious parallels to the time period of the First Crusade. Some clear references to actual historical events include the [[Vulgar Holy War]] (a parallel of the People's Crusade) and the Emperor's [[Indenture]] (a parallel of the oaths of homage extracted from the crusaders by Byzantine Emperor Alexius I).

==''Aspect-Emperor''==
The ''Second Apocalypse'' series is continued in the [[Aspect-Emperor]] trilogy, which describes events taking place 20 years after the conclusion of ''Prince of Nothing''. The first book of the series is ''[[The Judging Eye (Book)|The Judging Eye]]'', and was first published in 2009. The second is ''[[The White-Luck Warrior (Book)|The White-Luck Warrior]]'' and was published in 2011.

'''''The Aspect-Emperor''''' is an epic fantasy series of novels written by Canadian author [[R. Scott Bakker]], the second of three series that make up ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]'' cycle. It is a sequel to ''[[The Prince of Nothing]]'' trilogy and will be followed by another final series (either a trilogy or a duology) named ''[[The No-God]]''.

The events of ''The Aspect-Emperor'' take place twenty years after the conclusion of ''The Prince of Nothing'' trilogy. [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] now rules the entirety of the [[Three Seas]] as [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]], and leads all of the nations of the Three Seas on a Holy War against [[Golgotterath]] and the [[Consult]], the [[Great Ordeal]]. [[Drusas Achamian]], the former [[Mandate]] Schoolman and tutor of Anasûrimbor Kellhus, is now the only Wizard in [[Eärwa]] as he begins his own campaign across the [[Ancient North]] in hopes of finding the birthplace of the Aspect-Emperor. Meanwhile, in [[Momemn]], [[Esmenet]] struggles to keep control of the [[New Empire]] in her husband’s absence.

The fourth title, The Unholy Consult, was released in the US &amp; Canada on July 25, 2017 by The Overlook Press, and in the UK on July 6, 2017 by Orbit Books.

The series is currently expected to span nine books in total. The first seven volumes of ''The Second Apocalypse'' were published between 2003 and 2017.

The key feature distinguishing ''The Second Apocalypse'' from its contemporaries is the importance of philosophy to the work. The plot, characters, setting, and metaphysics of ''The Second Apocalypse'' are intertwined with philosophical positions unique to the series.

== Background ==
R. Scott Bakker began developing ''The Second Apocalypse'' while in college in the 1980s. The series was originally planned to be a trilogy with the first two books titled ''The Prince of Nothing'' and ''The Aspect-Emperor''. The third book was long referred to as ''The Book That Shall Not Be Named'' by Bakker, since its title book was considered to be a spoiler for the preceding volumes. When Bakker began writing the series in the early 2000s, however, he found it necessary to split each of the three novels into its own sub-series to incorporate all of the characters, themes and ideas he wished to explore. Bakker originally conceived of seven books, a trilogy and two duologies. This later shifted to a trilogy, a quartet and a duology, with the acknowledgement that the third series may also expand to a trilogy.

{{Main|The Prince of Nothing}}
''The Prince of Nothing'' trilogy was published between 2003 and 2006. It depicts the story of the First [[Holy War]] launched by the [[Inrithism|inrithi]] kingdoms against the heathen [[Fanimry|Fanim]] of the south to recover the holy city of [[Shimeh]] for the faithful. During the war, a man named [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] emerges from obscurity to become an exceptionally powerful and influential figure, and it is discovered that the [[Consult]], an alliance of forces united in their worship of the legendary [[No-God]], a nihilistic force of destruction, are manipulating events to pave the way for the No-God's return.

The first book of the trilogy, ''The Darkness That Comes Before'', was first published in 2003. It depicts the beginnings of the Holy War and the various faction's efforts to pervert it. The second book, ''The Warrior Prophet'', published in 2004, depicts Kellhus's rise to the status of prophet, while the third volume, ''The Thousandfold Thought'', published in 2006, depicts the conclusion of the Holy War.

The second series, ''The Aspect-Emperor'', picks up the story twenty years later with Kellhus leading the [[New Empire]] to directly seek out and confront the Consult. The first novel in this new series, ''The Judging Eye'', was published in January 2009, the second, ''The White-Luck Warrior'', was published in 2011. The third novel was split into two volumes due to length: ''[[The Great Ordeal]]'' was published in July 2016 and ''[[The Unholy Consult]]'' in 2017.

'''The Darkness That Comes Before''' is the first novel in both ''[[The Prince of Nothing]]'' trilogy and ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]'' series. It was [[R. Scott Bakker]]’s debut novel and was published in 2003.

==Publisher’s Summary==
Strikingly original in its conception, ambitious in scope, with characters engrossingly and vividly drawn, the first book in ''R. Scott Bakker’s Prince of Nothing'' series creates a remarkable world from whole cloth—its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals—the kind of all—embracing universe ''Tolkien'' and ''Herbert'' created unforgettably in the epic fantasies ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''Dune.''

It’s a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both two thousand years past and two thousand years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveller, Anasûrimbor Kellhus—part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence—from lands long thought dead.

''The Darkness That Comes Before'' is a history of this great Holy War, and like all histories, the survivours write its conclusion.

==Plot Summary==
{{Tdtcb chapters}}
==='''The Holy War'''===
The [[Holy War]] is the name of the great host called by [[Maithanet]], the [[Shriah]] of the [[Thousand Temples]], to liberate [[Shimeh]] from the heathen [[Fanimry|Fanim]] of [[Kian]]. Word of Maithanet’s call spreads across the [[Three Seas]], and faithful from all the great [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] nations—[[Galeoth]], [[Thunyerus]], [[Ce Tydonn]], [[Conriya]], [[High Ainon]], and their tributaries—travel to the city of [[Momemn]], the capital of the [[Nansur Empire]], to become Men of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]].

Almost from the outset, the gathering host is mired in politics and controversy. First, Maithanet somehow convinces the [[Scarlet Spires]], the most powerful of the sorcerous [[The Schools|Schools]], to join his Holy War. Despite the outrage this provokes—[[sorcery]] is anathema to the Inrithi—the Men of the Tusk realize they need the Scarlet Spires to counter the heathen [[Cishaurim]], the [[sorcerer]]-priests of the Fanim. The Holy War would be doomed without one of the Major Schools. The question is one of why the Scarlet Schoolmen would agree to such a perilous arrangement. Unknown to most, [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]], the Grandmaster of the Scarlet Spires, has waged a long and secret war against the Cishaurim, who for no apparent reason assassinated his predecessor, [[Sasheoka]], some ten years previously.

Second, [[Ikurei Xerius III]], the Emperor of Nansur, hatches an intricate plot to usurp the Holy War for his own ends. Much of what is now heathen Kian once belonged to the Nansur, and Xerius has made recovering the Empire’s lost provinces his heart’s most fervent desire. Since the Holy War gathers in the Nansur Empire, it can march only if provisioned by the Emperor, something he refuses to do until every leader of the Holy War signs his [[Indenture]], a written oath to cede all lands conquered to him.

Of course, the first [[caste]]-nobles to arrive repudiate the Indenture, and a stalemate ensues. As the Holy War’s numbers swell into the hundreds of thousands, however, the titular leaders of the host begin to grow restless. Since they war in the [[God of Gods|God]]’s name, they think themselves invincible, and as a result see little reason to share the glory with those yet to arrive. A Conriyan noble named [[Nersei Calmemunis]] comes to an accommodation with the Emperor, and convinces his fellows to sign the Imperial Indenture. Once provisioned, most of those gathered march, even though their lords and a greater part of the Holy War have yet to arrive. Because the host consists primarily of lordless rabble, it comes to be called the [[Vulgar Holy War]].

Despite Maithanet’s attempts to bring the makeshift host to heel, it continues marching southward, and passes into heathen lands, where—precisely as the Emperor had planned—the Fanim destroy it utterly.

Xerius knows that in military terms, the loss of the Vulgar Holy War is insignificant, since the rabble that largely constituted it would have proven more a liability than an advantage in battle. In political terms, however, the Vulgar Holy War’s destruction is invaluable, since it has shown Maithanet and the Men of the Tusk the true mettle of their adversary. The Fanim, as the Nansur well know, are not to be trifled with, even with the God’s favour. Only an outstanding general, Xerius claims, can assure the Holy War’s victory—a man like his nephew, [[Ikurei Conphas]], who, after his recent victory over the dread [[Scylvendi]] at the [[Battle of Kiyuth]], has been hailed as the greatest tactician of his age. The leaders of the Holy War need only sign the Imperial Indenture, and Conphas’s preternatural skill and insight will be theirs.

Maithanet, it seems, now finds himself in a dilemma. As Shriah, he can compel the Emperor to provision the Holy War, but he cannot compel him to send Ikurei Conphas, his only living heir. The first truly great Inrithi potentates of the Holy War—Prince [[Nersei Proyas]] of Conriya, Prince [[Coithus Saubon]] of Galeoth, Earl [[Hoga Gothyelk]] of Ce Tydonn, King-Regent [[Chepheramunni]] of High Ainon—arrive in the midst of this controversy, and the Holy War amasses new strength, though it remains a hostage in effect, bound by the scarcity of food to the walls of Momemn and the Emperor’s granaries. To a man, the caste-nobles repudiate Xerius’s Indenture and demand that he provision them. The Men of the Tusk begin raiding the surrounding countryside. In retaliation, the Emperor calls in elements of the Imperial Army. Pitched battles are fought.

In an effort to forestall disaster, Maithanet calls a Council of Great and Lesser Names, and all the leaders of the Holy War gather in the Emperor’s palace, the [[Andiamine Heights]], to make their arguments. Here Nersei Proyas shocks the assembly by offering a many-scarred Scylvendi Chieftain, a veteran of past wars against the Fanim, as a surrogate for the famed Ikurei Conphas. The Scylvendi, [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]], shares hard words with both the Emperor and his nephew, and the leaders of the Holy War are impressed. The Shriah’s Envoy, however, remains undecided: the Scylvendi are as apostate as the Fanim, after all. Only the wise words of Prince [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] of [[Atrithau]] settle the matter. The Envoy reads the decree demanding that the Emperor, under pain of Shrial Censure, provision the Men of the Tusk.

The Holy War will march.

==='''Drusas Achamian'''===
[[Drusas Achamian]] is a sorcerer sent by the School of [[Mandate]] to investigate Maithanet and his Holy War. Though he no longer believes in his School’s ancient mission, he travels to [[Sumna]], where the Thousand Temples is based, in the hope of learning more about the mysterious Shriah, whom the Mandate fears could be an agent of the [[Consult]]. In the course of his probe, he resumes an old love affair with a harlot named [[Esmenet]], and despite his misgivings, he recruits a former student of his, a Shrial Priest named [[Paro Inrau]], to report on Maithanet’s activities. During this time, his [[Seswatha’s Dreams|nightmares]] of the [[Apocalypse]] intensify, particularly those involving the so-called “[[Celmomian Prophecy]],” which foretells the return of a descendant of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]] before the Second Apocalypse.

Then Inrau dies under mysterious circumstances. Overcome by guilt, and heartbroken by Esmenet’s refusal to cease taking custom, Achamian flees Sumna and travels to Momemn, where the Holy War gathers under the Emperor’s covetous and uneasy eyes. A powerful rival of the Mandate, a School called the Scarlet Spires, has joined the Holy War to prosecute its long contest with the sorcerer-priests of the Cishaurim, who reside in Shimeh. [[Seidru Nautzera]], Achamian’s Mandate handler, has ordered him to observe them and the Holy War. When he reaches the encampment, Achamian joins the fire of [[Krijates Xinemus]], an old friend of his from Conriya.

Pursuing his investigation of Inrau’s death, Achamian convinces Xinemus to take him to see another old student of his, Prince Nersei Proyas of Conriya, who’s become a confidant of the enigmatic Shriah. When Proyas scoffs at his suspicions and repudiates him as a blasphemer, Achamian implores him to write Maithanet regarding the circumstances of Inrau’s death. Embittered, Achamian leaves his old student’s pavilion certain his meagre request will go unfulfilled.

Then a man hailing from the [[Ancient North|distant north]] arrives—a man calling himself ''Anasûrimbor'' Kellhus. Battered by his recurrent dreams of the Apocalypse, Achamian finds himself fearing the worst: the Second Apocalypse. Is Kellhus’s arrival a mere coincidence, or is he the Harbinger foretold in the Celmomian Prophecy? Achamian questions the man, only to find himself utterly disarmed by his humour, honesty, and intellect. They talk history and philosophy long into the night, and before retiring, Kellhus asks Achamian to be his teacher. Inexplicably awed and affected by the stranger, Achamian agrees …

But he finds himself in a dilemma. The reappearance of an Anasûrimbor is something the School of Mandate simply has to know—few discoveries could be more significant. But he fears what his brother Schoolmen will do: a lifetime of dreaming horrors, he knows, has made them cruel and pitiless. And he blames them, moreover, for the death of Inrau.

Before he can resolve this dilemma, Achamian is summoned by the Emperor’s nephew, Ikurei Conphas, to the Imperial Palace in Momemn, where the Emperor wants him to assess a highly placed adviser of his—an old man called [[Skeaös]]—for the [[Mark]] of sorcery. The Emperor himself, Ikurei Xerius III, brings Achamian to Skeaös, demanding to know whether the old man bears the blasphemous taint of sorcery. Achamian sees nothing amiss.

Skeaös, however, sees something in Achamian. He begins writhing against his chains, speaking a tongue from Achamian’s ancient dreams. Impossibly, the old man breaks free, killing several before being burned by the Emperor’s sorcerers. Dumbfounded, Achamian confronts the howling Skeaös, only to watch horrified as his face peels apart and opens into scorched ''limbs'' …

The abomination before him, he realizes, ''is a Consult spy,'' one that can mimic and replace others without bearing sorcery’s telltale Mark. A [[Skin-spies|skin-spy]]. Achamian flees the palace without warning the Emperor and his court, knowing they would think his conviction nonsense. For them, Skeaös can only be an artifact of the heathen Cishaurim, whose art also bears no Mark. Senseless to his surroundings, Achamian wanders back to Xinemus’s camp, so absorbed by his horror that he fails to see or hear Esmenet, who has come to rejoin him at long last.

The mysteries surrounding Maithanet. The coming of Anasûrimbor Kellhus. The discovery of the first Consult spy in generations … How can he doubt it any longer? The Second Apocalypse is about to begin.

Alone in his humble tent, he weeps, overcome by loneliness, dread, and remorse.

==='''Esmenet'''===
[[Esmenet]] is a Sumni prostitute who mourns both her life and her dead [[Mimara|daughter]]. When Achamian arrives on his mission to learn more about Maithanet, she readily takes him in. During this time, she continues to take and service her customers, knowing full well the pain this causes Achamian. But she really has no choice: sooner or later, she realizes, Achamian will be called away. And yet she falls ever deeper in love with the hapless sorcerer, in part because of the respect he accords her, and in part because of the worldly nature of his work. Though her sex has condemned her to sit half-naked in her window, the world beyond has always been her passion. The intrigues of the Great Factions, the machinations of the Consult: these are the things that quicken her soul.

Then disaster strikes: Achamian’s informant, Inrau, is murdered, and the bereaved Schoolman is forced to travel to Momemn. Esmenet begs him to take her with him, but he refuses, and she finds herself once again marooned in her old life. Not long after, a threatening stranger comes to her room, demanding to know everything about Achamian. Twisting her desire against her, the man ravishes her, and Esmenet finds herself answering all his questions. Come morning he vanishes as suddenly as he appears, leaving only pools of black seed to mark his passing.

Horrified, Esmenet flees Sumna, determined to find Achamian and tell him what happened. In her bones, she knows the stranger is somehow connected to the Consult. On her way to Momemn, she pauses in a village, hoping to find someone to repair her broken sandal. When the villagers recognize the [[Sign of Gierra|whore’s tattoo]] on her hand, they begin stoning her—the punishment the Tusk demands of prostitutes. Only the sudden appearance of a [[Shrial Knights|Shrial Knight]] named [[Cutias Sarcellus]] saves her, and she has the satisfaction of watching her tormentors humbled. Sarcellus takes her the rest of the way to Momemn, and Esmenet finds herself growing more and more infatuated with his wealth and aristocratic manner. He seems so free of the melancholy and indecision that plague Achamian.

Once they reach the Holy War, Esmenet stays with Sarcellus, even though she knows Achamian is only miles away. As the Shrial Knight continually reminds her, Schoolmen such as Achamian are forbidden to take wives. If she were to run to him, he says, it would be only a matter of time before he abandoned her again.

Weeks pass, and she finds herself esteeming Sarcellus less and pining for Achamian more and more. Finally, on the night before the Holy War is to march, she sets off in search of the portly sorcerer, determined to tell him everything that has happened. After a harrowing search, she finally locates Xinemus’s camp, only to find herself too ashamed to make her presence known. She hides in the darkness instead, waiting for Achamian to appear, and wondering at the strange collection of men and women about the fire. When dawn arrives without any sign of Achamian, Esmenet wanders across the abandoned site, only to see him trudging toward her. She holds out her arms to him, weeping with joy and sorrow …

And he simply walks past her as though she were a stranger.

Heartbroken, she flees, determined to make her own way in the Holy War.

==='''Cnaiür urs Skiötha'''===
[[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] is a Chieftain of the [[Utemot]], a tribe of Scylvendi, who are feared across the Three Seas for their skill and ferocity in war. Because of the events surrounding the death of his father, [[Skiötha urs Hannut]], some thirty years previously, Cnaiür is despised by his own people, though none dare challenge him because of his savage strength and his cunning in war. Word arrives that the Emperor’s nephew, Ikurei Conphas, has invaded the [[Jiünati Steppe|Holy Steppe]], and Cnaiür rides with the Utemot to join the Scylvendi horde on the distant Imperial frontier. Knowing Conphas’s reputation, Cnaiür senses a trap, but his warnings go unheeded by [[Xunnurit]], the chieftain elected King-of-Tribes for the coming battle. Cnaiür can only watch as the disaster unfolds.

Escaping the horde’s destruction, Cnaiür returns to the pastures of the Utemot more anguished than ever. He flees the whispers and the looks of his fellow tribesmen and rides to the graves of his ancestors, where he finds a grievously wounded man sitting upon his dead father’s barrow, surrounded by circles of dead [[Sranc]]. Warily approaching, Cnaiür nightmarishly realizes that he ''recognizes'' the man—or almost recognizes him. He resembles [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]] in almost every respect, save that he is too young …

Moënghus had been captured thirty years previous, when Cnaiür was little more than a stripling, and given to Cnaiür’s father as a slave. He claimed to be [[Dûnyain]], a people possessed of an extraordinary wisdom, and Cnaiür spent many hours with him, speaking of things forbidden to Scylvendi warriors. What happened afterward—the seduction, the murder of Skiötha, and Moënghus’s subsequent escape—has tormented Cnaiür ever since. Though he once loved the man, he now hates him with a deranged intensity. If only he could kill Moënghus, he believes, his heart could be made whole.

Now, impossibly, this double has come to him, travelling the same path as the original.

Realizing the stranger could make possible his vengeance, Cnaiür takes him captive. The man, who calls himself Anasûrimbor Kellhus, claims to be Moënghus’s son. The Dûnyain, he says, have sent him to assassinate his father in a faraway city called Shimeh. But as much as Cnaiür wants to believe this story, he’s wary and troubled. After years of obsessively pondering Moënghus, he’s come to realize that the Dûnyain are gifted with preternatural skills and intelligence. Their sole purpose, he now knows, is domination, though where others use force and fear, they use deceit and love.

The story Kellhus has told him, Cnaiür realizes, is precisely the story a Dûnyain seeking escape and safe passage across Scylvendi lands would tell. Nevertheless, he makes a bargain with the man, agreeing to accompany him on his quest. The two of them strike out across the Steppe, locked in a shadowy war of word and passion. Time and again, Cnaiür finds himself drawn into Kellhus’s insidious nets, only to recall himself at the last moment. Only his hatred of Moënghus and knowledge of the Dûnyain preserve him.

Near the Imperial frontier they encounter a party of hostile Scylvendi raiders. Kellhus’s unearthly skill in battle both astounds and terrifies Cnaiür. In the battle’s aftermath they find a captive concubine, a woman named [[Serwë]], cowering among the raiders’ chattel. Struck by her beauty, Cnaiür takes her as his prize, and through her he learns of Maithanet’s Holy War for Shimeh, the city where Moënghus supposedly dwells … Can this be a coincidence?

Coincidence or not, the Holy War forces Cnaiür to reconsider his original plan to travel around the Empire, where his Scylvendi heritage will mean almost certain death. With the Fanim rulers of Shimeh girding for war, the only possible way they can reach the holy city is to become Men of the Tusk. They have no choice, he realizes, but to join the Holy War, which, according to Serwë, gathers about the city of Momemn in the heart of the Empire—the one place he cannot go. Now that they have safely crossed the Steppe, Cnaiür is convinced Kellhus will kill him: the Dûnyain brook no liabilities.

Descending the mountains into the Empire, Cnaiür confronts Kellhus, who claims he has use of him still. While Serwë watches in horror, the two men battle on the mountainous heights, and though Cnaiür is able to surprise Kellhus, the man easily overpowers him, holding him by the throat over a precipice. To prove his intent to keep their bargain, he spares Cnaiür’s life. After so many years among worldborn men, Kellhus claims, Moënghus will be far too powerful for him to face alone. They will need an army, he says, and unlike Cnaiür he knows nothing of war.

Despite his misgivings, Cnaiür believes him, and they resume their journey. As the days pass, Cnaiür watches Serwë become more and more infatuated with Kellhus. Though troubled by this, he refuses to admit as much, reminding himself that warriors care nothing for women, particularly those taken as the spoils of battle. What does it matter that she belongs to Kellhus during the day? She is Cnaiür’s at night.

After a desperate journey and pursuit through the heart of the Empire, they at last find their way to Momemn and the Holy War, where they are taken before one of the Holy War’s leaders, a Conriyan Prince named Nersei Proyas. In keeping with their plan, Cnaiür claims to be the last of the Utemot, travelling with Anasûrimbor Kellhus, a Prince of the northern city of Atrithau, who has dreamed of the Holy War from afar. Proyas, however, is far more interested in Cnaiür’s knowledge of the Fanim and their way of battle. Obviously impressed by what he has to say, the Conriyan Prince takes Cnaiür and his companions under his protection.

Soon afterward, Proyas takes Cnaiür and Kellhus to a meeting of the Holy War’s leaders and the Emperor, where the fate of the Holy War is to be decided. Ikurei Xerius III has refused to provision the Men of the Tusk unless they swear to return all the lands they wrest from the Fanim to the Empire. The Shriah, Maithanet, can force the Emperor to provision them, but he fears the Holy War lacks the leadership to overcome the Fanim. The Emperor offers his brilliant nephew, Ikurei Conphas, flush from his spectacular victory over the Scylvendi at Kiyuth, but only—once again—if the leaders of the Holy War pledge to surrender their future conquests. In a daring gambit, Proyas offers ''Cnaiür'' in Conphas’s stead. A vicious war of words ensues, and Cnaiür manages to best the precocious Imperial Nephew. The Shriah’s representative orders the Emperor to provision the Men of the Tusk. The Holy War will march.

In a mere matter of days, Cnaiür has gone from a fugitive to a leader of the greatest host ever assembled in the Three Seas. What does it mean for a Scylvendi to treat with outland princes, with peoples he is sworn to destroy? What must he surrender to see his vengeance through?

That night, he watches Serwë surrender to Kellhus body and soul, and he wonders at the horror he has delivered to the Holy War. What will Anasûrimbor Kellhus—a Dûnyain—make of these Men of the Tusk? No matter, he tells himself, the Holy War marches to distant Shimeh—to Moënghus and the promise of blood.

==='''Anasûrimbor Kellhus'''===
[[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] is a monk sent by his order, the Dûnyain, to search for his father, Anasûrimbor Moënghus.

Since discovering the secret redoubt of the [[Kûniüri]]c High Kings during the Apocalypse some two thousand years previous, the Dûnyain have concealed themselves, breeding for reflex and intellect, and continually training in the ways of limb, thought, and face—all for the sake of reason, the sacred [[Logos]]. In the effort to transform themselves into the perfect expression of the Logos, the Dûnyain have bent their entire existence to mastering the irrationalities that determine human thought: history, custom, and passion. In this way, they believe, they will eventually grasp what they call the [[Absolute]], and so become true self-moving souls.

But their glorious isolation is at an end. After thirty years of exile, one of their number, Anasûrimbor Moënghus, has reappeared in their dreams, demanding they send to him his son. Knowing only that his father dwells in a distant city called Shimeh, Kellhus undertakes an arduous journey through lands long abandoned by men. While wintering with a trapper named [[Leweth]], he discovers he can read the man’s thoughts through the nuances of his expression. Worldborn men, he realizes, are little more than children in comparison with the Dûnyain. Experimenting, he finds that he can exact anything from Leweth—any love, any sacrifice—with mere words. So what of his father, who has spent thirty years among such men? What is the extent of Anasûrimbor Moënghus’s power?

When a band of inhuman [[Sranc]] discovers Leweth’s steading, the two men are forced to flee. Leweth is wounded, and Kellhus leaves him for the Sranc, feeling no remorse. The Sranc overtake him, and after driving them away, he battles their [[Cet’ingira|leader]], a deranged [[Nonmen|Nonman]], who nearly undoes him with sorcery. Kellhus flees, racked by questions without answers: Sorcery, he’d been taught, was nothing more than superstition. Could the Dûnyain have been wrong? What other facts had they overlooked or suppressed?

Eventually he finds refuge in the ancient city of Atrithau, where, using his Dûnyain abilities, he assembles an expedition to cross the Sranc-infested plains of [[Suskara]]. After a harrowing trek, he crosses the frontier, only to be captured by a mad Scylvendi Chieftain named Cnaiür urs Skiötha—a man who both knows and hates his father, Moënghus.

Though his knowledge of the Dûnyain renders Cnaiür immune to direct manipulation, Kellhus quickly realizes he can turn the man’s thirst for vengeance to his advantage. Claiming to be an assassin sent to murder Moënghus, he asks the Scylvendi to join him on his quest. Overpowered by his hatred, Cnaiür reluctantly agrees, and the two men set out across the Jiünati Steppe. Time and again, Kellhus tries to secure the trust he needs to possess the man, but the barbarian continually rebuffs him. His hatred and his penetration are too great.

Then, near the Imperial frontier, they find a concubine named Serwë, who informs them of a Holy War gathering about Momemn—a Holy War for ''Shimeh.'' The fact that his father has summoned him to Shimeh at the same time, Kellhus realizes, can be no coincidence. But what could Moënghus be planning?

They cross the mountains into the Empire, and Kellhus watches Cnaiür struggle with the growing conviction that he’s outlived his usefulness. Thinking that murdering Kellhus is as close as he’ll ever come to murdering Moënghus, Cnaiür attacks him, only to be defeated. To prove that he still needs him, Kellhus spares his life. He must, Kellhus knows, dominate the Holy War, but he as yet knows nothing of warfare. The variables are too many. Though Cnaiür’s knowledge of Moënghus and the Dûnyain renders him a liability, his skill in war makes him invaluable. To secure this knowledge, Kellhus starts seducing Serwë, using her and her beauty as detours to the barbarian’s tormented heart.

Once in the Empire, they stumble across a patrol of Imperial cavalrymen; their journey to Momemn quickly becomes a desperate race. When they finally reach the encamped Holy War, they find themselves before Nersei Proyas, the Crown Prince of Conriya. To secure a position of honour among the Men of the Tusk, Kellhus lies, and claims to be a Prince of Atrithau. To lay the groundwork for his future domination, he claims to have suffered dreams of the Holy War—implying, without saying as much, that they were ''godsent.'' Since Proyas is more concerned with Cnaiür and how he can use the barbarian’s knowledge of battle to thwart the Emperor, these claims are accepted without any real scrutiny. Only the Mandate Schoolman accompanying Proyas, Drusas Achamian, seems troubled by him—especially by his name.

The following evening, Kellhus dines with the sorcerer, disarming him with humour, flattering him with questions. He learns of the Apocalypse and the Consult and many other sundry things, and though he knows Achamian harbours some terror regarding the name [[Anasûrimbor Dynasty|Anasûrimbor]], he asks the melancholy man to become his teacher. The Dûnyain, Kellhus has come to realize, have been mistaken about many things, the existence of sorcery among them. There is so much he must know before he confronts his father …

A final gathering is called to settle the issue between the Lords of the Holy War, who want to march, and the Emperor, who refuses to provision them. With Cnaiür at his side, Kellhus charts the souls of all those present, calculating the ways he might bring them under his thrall. Among the Emperor’s advisers, however, he observes an expression he cannot read. The man, he realizes, possesses a ''false face.'' While Ikurei Conphas and the Inrithi caste-nobles bicker, Kellhus studies the man, and determines that his name is Skeaös by reading the lips of his interlocutors. Could this Skeaös be an agent of his father?

Before he can draw any conclusions, however, his scrutiny is noticed by the Emperor himself, who has the adviser seized. Though the entire Holy War celebrates the Emperor’s defeat, Kellhus is more perplexed than ever. Never has he undertaken a study so deep.

That night he consummates his relationship with Serwë, continuing the patient work of undoing Cnaiür—as all Men of the Tusk must be undone. Somewhere, a shadowy faction lurks behind faces of false skin. Far to the south in Shimeh, Anasûrimbor Moënghus awaits the coming storm.

'''The Warrior-Prophet''' is the second novel in both ''[[The Prince of Nothing]]'' trilogy and the ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]'' series. It was published in 2004.

==Publisher’s Summary==
The first battle against the heathen has been won, but while the Great Names plot and squabble over the spoils, Kellhus patiently extends his influence, drawing more followers to his banner.

The sorcerer Achamian and his lover, Esmenet, submit entirely, only to have their faith tested in unimaginable ways. The warrior Cnaiür falls ever deeper into madness. The skin-spies of the Consult watch with growing trepidation. And as the vast host of the Holy War endures its sternest test in the searing wastes of the desert, a name—a title—begins to be whispered amongst the faithful.

But who is the Warrior-Prophet: a dangerous heretic, who turns brother against brother? Or the only man who can avert the Second Apocalypse? The Holy War stands on a knife edge. If all is not to be lost the great powers will have to choose between their most desperate desires and their most ingrained prejudice. Between hatred and hope. Between the Warrior-Prophet and the end of the world …

==Plot Summary==
==='''The Holy War'''===
Free of the [[Ikurei Xerius III|Emperor]]’s machinations, the Lords of the [[Holy War]] fall to squabbling among each other, and the Holy War fractures into its various nationalities as it marches toward the heathen frontier.
Contingent by contingent, it gathers beneath [[Asgilioch]] on the heathen frontier.

But Prince [[Coithus Saubon]], the leader of the [[Galeoth]] contingent, is too impatient, and on the prophetic advice of Prince [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], he marches with the [[Ce Tydonn|Tydonni]], the [[Thunyerus|Thunyeri]], and the [[Shrial Knights]]. The Imperial Army under [[Ikurei Conphas]] and the [[Conriya]]ns under Prince [[Nersei Proyas]] remain at Asgilioch, awaiting the [[High Ainon|Ainoni]] and the all-important [[Scarlet Spires]].

[[Skauras ab Nalajan]], the leader of the [[Kian]]ene host, surprises Saubon and his impetuous peers on the [[Mengedda Plains|Plains of Mengedda]]. A [[Fifth Battle of Mengedda|desperate battle]] follows, where, just as Prince Kellhus predicted, the Shrial Knights suffer grievously saving the Holy War from a cadre of [[Cishaurim]]. As the day wanes, the rest of the Holy War appears in the hills, and the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] host is completely routed.

The Governorate of [[Gedea]] falls, though the Emperor manages to take her capital, [[Hinnereth]], through trickery. The Men of the Tusk continue south. Broken by their defeat on the Plains of Mengedda, the Kianene fall back to the south bank of the [[River Sempis]], yielding northern [[Shigek]] to the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] invaders. Prince Kellhus begins giving regular sermons beneath the famed [[Ziggurats of Shigek]]. Many in the Holy War begin referring to him as the “Warrior-Prophet.”

With [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] as their general, the Men of the Tusk cross the Sempis Delta, and a second great battle is fought beneath the Kianene fortress of [[Anwurat]]. Despite the dissolution of Cnaiür’s command and the martial cunning of Skauras, the Men of the Tusk prevail once again. The sons of Kian are hacked to ruin.

Anxious to press the advantage, the [[Great Names]] then lead the Holy War south across the coastal deserts of [[Khemema]], depending on the Imperial Fleet to keep them supplied with fresh water. The [[Padirajah]], however, surprises the fleet at the [[Battle of Trantis Bay|Bay of Trantis]], and the Men of the Tusk find themselves stranded in the burning wastes without water. Thousands upon thousands die. Only Prince Kellhus’s discovery of water beneath the dunes saves the Inrithi from total annihilation.

The remnants of the Holy War drift from the desert and descend upon the great mercantile city of [[Caraskand]]. After a number of abortive assaults, the Men of the Tusk prepare for a long siege. The winter rains come, and with them, disease. At the height of the plague, hundreds of Inrithi perish every night. Only a Fanim traitor allows the Holy War to breach Caraskand’s mighty fortifications. The Men of the Tusk show no quarter.

But even as the city falls, [[Kascamandri ab Tepherokar]], the Padirajah himself, approaches with another great host. Suddenly the besiegers find themselves besieged in a sacked city. Diseases of malnutrition, then outright starvation soon begin afflicting them. Meanwhile, the tensions between traditional Inrithi and those acclaiming Prince Kellhus as a prophet—the Orthodox and the [[Zaudunyani]]—grow to the point of riot and violence.

Incited by the accusations of [[Cutias Sarcellus]] and Ikurei Conphas, the Lords of the Holy War turn against Prince Kellhus. He is denounced, declared a False Prophet, and, in accordance with ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]],'' seized and bound to the corpse of his wife, [[Serwë]], who is executed by Sarcellus. He is then lashed to an iron ring—a circumfix—and hung from a [[Umiaki|tree]]. Thousands gather in solemn vigil.

After Cnaiür reveals Sarcellus as a [[Skin-spies|skin-spy]], the Men of the Tusk repent, and the Warrior-Prophet is cut down from the Circumfix. Moved by a profound fervour, they assemble outside the gates of Caraskand. The Grandees of Kian charge their grim ranks and are utterly undone. The Padirajah himself falls before the Warrior-Prophet, though his son, [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]], survives to flee east with the remnants of the heathen army.

The road to Holy [[Shimeh]] is now open.

But far to the north, in the shadow of dread [[Golgotterath]], the [[Consult]] rides openly once again, torturing those Men they find with a single, implacable question: “Who are the [[Dûnyain]]?”

==='''Drusas Achamian'''===
[[Drusas Achamian]] faces a dilemma, the greatest he’s ever encountered. Using the [[Cants of Calling]], he contacts the [[Mandate]] and informs them of his dread discovery beneath the [[Andiamine Heights]], but he says nothing of Anasûrimbor Kellhus, even though the man’s name could very well mean the [[Celmomian Prophecy]]—that an Anasûrimbor would return at the end of the world—has been fulfilled.

The omission torments him, but the more time he spends teaching Kellhus on the march, the more he finds himself in awe of the man. With strokes of a stick across the ground, Kellhus rewrites classical logic, devises new and more subtle geometries. He regularly anticipates the insights of [[Eärwa]]’s greatest thinkers, even extends them in astonishing ways. And he never forgets anything.

Achamian, especially after the debacle with [[Paro Inrau]] in [[Sumna]], is under no illusions regarding his [[The Schools|School]]. He knows what they would do with Prince Anasûrimbor Kellhus. So he convinces himself that he needs time to determine whether Kellhus is in fact the Harbinger of the [[Apocalypse]]. He decides to betray the Mandate, to risk the very future of humanity, for the sake of a single, remarkable man.

While the Holy War awaits the arrival of the last stragglers about Asgilioch, he turns to drink and whores to silence his misgivings, only to find [[Esmenet]] among the camp-followers. Their reunion is both ardent and awkward. Afterward, Achamian takes her to his tent as his wife. After a lifetime of fruitless wandering, he finds himself terrified by the prospect of happiness. How can anyone be happy in the shadow of the Apocalypse?

As the Holy War marches ever deeper into Fanim territory, he continues teaching Kellhus. During this time, Achamian and Esmenet make a game of interpreting Kellhus, becoming more and more convinced of his divinity. In the course of these ruminations, Achamian confesses his fear that Kellhus may be one of the [[The Few|Few]]—those who can work [[sorcery]]. When Kellhus claims as much shortly after, Achamian insists on proof, using a small, demon-haunted [[Wathi Doll]] he obtained in High Ainon. [[Krijates Xinemus]] is outraged by the blasphemous demonstration, and Achamian finds himself estranged from his old friend.

When the Holy War reaches Shigek, Kellhus finally asks Achamian to teach him the [[Gnosis]]—something that would complete his betrayal of the Mandate. Needing solitude, Achamian travels alone to the [[Sareötic Library]], where the [[sorcerer]]s of the Scarlet Spires ambush and abduct him.

The torment drags on for weeks. [[Heramari Iyokus]], the lead interrogator, even captures and blinds Xinemus in an attempt to wring more information from Achamian. The Scarlet Spires, it seems, have learned of the events beneath the Andiamine Heights. They know about [[Skeaös]] and the skin-spies, and with the very future of his School at stake, [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]] is desperate to extract as much intelligence as possible.

Despite his sorcerous constraints, Achamian is able to call out to his Wathi Doll, which has been buried in the ruins of the Sareötic Library. After a long wait the Doll arrives and breaks the [[Uroborian Circle]] that imprisons him. Achamian at last shows the Gnosis to the Scarlet Spires. Though Iyokus escapes his vengeance, he and Xinemus are at last free.

After recuperating, the two friends set out to rejoin the Holy War, their relationship now marred by the resentment Xinemus bears for losing his eyes. They find the Men of the Tusk trapped and starving in Caraskand and learn of the Circumfixion of Kellhus and Serwë. Achamian immediately sets out to find Esmenet, relieved beyond words to discover that she survived the desert.

He finds her with the Zaudunyani. She tells him that she is pregnant with Kellhus’s child.

Achamian goes to the ring-bound Kellhus thinking only of murder. Instead he learns that Consult skin-spies riddle the Holy War. Kellhus, it seems, can see them. He tells Achamian that the Second Apocalypse has in fact begun.

Despite his sorrow and hatred, Achamian goes to Proyas arguing that Kellhus must be saved. Proyas agrees to summon the other Great Names, and Achamian presents his case, arguing that the world is doomed without Anasûrimbor Kellhus, only to be made a laughingstock by Ikurei Conphas.

He fails to convince the Lords of the Holy War.

==='''Esmenet'''===
Thinking Achamian has repudiated her, [[Esmenet]] loses herself in the Holy War and eventually joins a troop of camp prostitutes. But at Asgilioch, she finds Achamian kneeling in the crowds, drunk and beaten. Never has she seen him so desperate. They reconcile, even though she cannot confess the truth of her affair with Sarcellus.

He tells her about Skeaös and the events beneath the Andiamine Heights, about his failure to tell the Mandate about Kellhus. She consoles him even as she struggles to grasp the dread import of his words. He insists the Second Apocalypse is coming, and though it seems something too horrific, too abstract, to be real, she finds herself believing him. She joins him in his humble tent, and becomes his wife in spirit if not in ritual.

Achamian introduces her to Kellhus, Serwë, Xinemus, and everyone else about their motley yet extraordinary camp fire. At first she regards Kellhus with suspicion, but she soon finds the wonder of the man as irresistible as everyone else.

As the Holy War marches across Gedea, she watches as Kellhus grows in prestige and reputation, becoming more and more convinced that he must be the prophet he claims not to be. During the same time her love of Achamian deepens, though she has difficulty trusting it.

Then, in Shigek, Kellhus asks Achamian to teach him the Gnosis. Since this would represent a final, ultimate betrayal of the Mandate, Achamian leaves for the Sareötic Library to meditate alone. He and Esmenet exchange hard words. The following night Kellhus awakens her with grim tidings: the Sareötic Library burns, and Achamian is missing.

She mourns him the way she once mourned her dead [[Mimara|daughter]]. While the Men of the Tusk assail the South Bank, she remains alone in Achamian’s tent, refusing, despite Xinemus’s entreaties, to rejoin the Holy War. How would Achamian find her if she moved? After the [[Battle of Anwurat]], Kellhus comes to her with Serwë, and with reason and compassion convinces her to join them on the continued march.

She finds their company awkward at first, but Kellhus is able to make sense of her melancholy, to give shape to the morass of accumulated sorrow that burdens her heart. He begins teaching her how to read—as a way to distract her, she suspects. As the weeks pass and the Holy War begins its disastrous march across the desert, she starts to resign herself to the fact that Achamian is dead.

She also finds herself more and more attracted to Kellhus.

Despite her shame, despite her resolutions, the chance intimacies accumulate. His words seem to carve her at the joints, cutting ever closer to truths she cannot bear. She admits her affair with Sarcellus, all her small betrayals of Achamian. Then, at last, overcome by shame and grief, she confesses the truth about her daughter: Mimara didn’t die all those years ago. Esmenet sold the girl to slavers to forestall starvation.

She and Kellhus make love the following morning.

The long suffering in the desert seems to sanctify their relationship. Everything appears transformed. She even casts away her Whore’s Shell, the contraceptive charm used by most prostitutes, something she never even considered with Achamian. Esmenet becomes the Warrior-Prophet’s second wife. For the first time in her life she feels shriven—pure.

Caraskand is besieged and overcome. Serwë gives birth to the infant [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II]]. And Kellhus yields Esmenet more and more power within the growing ranks of Zaudunyani, raising her above even his closest disciples, the [[Nascenti]]. She becomes pregnant.

Then suddenly everything seems to collapse. The Padirajah traps the Holy War in Caraskand. Misery and riot own the streets. The Great Names execute Serwë and condemn Kellhus to the Circumfix. All seems lost …

Until Achamian returns.

==='''Cnaiür urs Skiötha'''===
[[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]]’s torment deepens. Though the Men of the Tusk mean nothing to him, he sees his own undoing in their slow capitulation to Kellhus. He alone knows the truth of the Dûnyain, which means he knows that Kellhus will eventually betray him in the prosecution of his obscure ends. Just as he knows the man will betray the Holy War.

As the Holy War marches deeper into Fanim territory, he tries to teach Prince Proyas the rudiments of war as practised by the Kianene. Assigned by Proyas to command a cohort of Conriyan outriders, he returns to the camp he shares with Kellhus, Achamian, and the others of the less and less. He knows that Kellhus now possesses Serwë body and soul, and when he returns, he finds himself punishing her for Kellhus’s outrage. Secretly he loves her, or so he tells himself.

In the arid highlands of Gedea, he decides he can tolerate no more. He refuses to share Kellhus’s fire, and demands that Serwë, whom he claims as his prize, come with him. Kellhus denies him. Since concern for women is unmanly, Cnaiür relinquishes her, though she continues to tyrannize his thoughts. His madness burns brighter. Some nights he roams the countryside, raping and murdering indiscriminately.

After the Holy War seizes the north bank of the River Sempis, the Lords of the Holy War assign Cnaiür the task of planning the assault on southern Shigek. Impressed by his insight and cunning, they acclaim him their general for the impending battle. Kellhus comes to him, offering Serwë in exchange for the secrets of battle. Cnaiür knows that his knowledge of war is the last advantage he possesses over the Dûnyain, the only thing Kellhus still needs from him, but Serwë has somehow become more important than anything. She is his prize, his proof …

Cnaiür agrees. Riven by recriminations, he teaches Kellhus the principles of war.

Despite all his efforts, Skauras outwits him on the battlefield; only determination and good fortune save the Holy War from defeat. Something breaks within Cnaiür. At the height of the crisis he leaves Kellhus and the others, abandons his command to collect his prize. But when he finds Serwë, ''another'' Kellhus is beating her, demanding information. He surprises the second Kellhus, stabbing him in the shoulder. The man flees, but not before Cnaiür glimpses his face crack open …

Cnaiür seizes Serwë, begins dragging her to his camp. She rages at him, tells him that he beats her because she lies with Kellhus the way he had lain with Kellhus’s father. She tries to cut her own throat.

Bewildered and undone, Cnaiür wanders aimlessly through the camp. Later that night, as the Men of the Tusk celebrate their victory, Kellhus finds him at the edge of the [[Meneanor]], howling at the breakers. Thinking he is [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]], Cnaiür begs him to end his misery. The Dûnyain refuses.

Throughout the disastrous desert march and the siege of Caraskand, madness rules Cnaiür’s heart. Not until the city falls does he recover some semblance of his former self. Fomenting against Kellhus, the Great Names come to him, hoping to confirm rumours that Kellhus is not a true prince of [[Atrithau]]. The estrangement between Cnaiür and Kellhus is no secret. Thinking the Holy War doomed, Cnaiür decides to take what compensation he can. He names Kellhus a “prince of nothing.”

Only when Serwë is murdered by Sarcellus does he realize the consequences of his betrayal. “Lie made flesh,” Kellhus calls out to him before he is seized. “The hunt need not end.” Cnaiür flees, and in a moment of resurgent madness cuts a swazond across his own throat.

He obsesses over the Dûnyain’s final words. When the Mandate Schoolman confronts the Lords of the Holy War with the severed head of a Consult skin-spy, he finally grasps their meaning. He follows Sarcellus, who hastens from the assembly to the [[Csokis|temple-complex]] where his brother Shrial Knights guard Kellhus upon the Circumfix. Knowing he intends to kill the Dûnyain, Cnaiür intercepts him, and they duel before the starving masses gathered about the dying Warrior-Prophet. But the skin-spy is too fast, too skilled. Cnaiür is saved only when [[Incheiri Gotian]], the Grandmaster of the Shrial Knights, distracts Sarcellus by demanding to know how he learned to fight so. Exhausted, bloodied, Cnaiür beheads the counterfeit Shrial Knight.

Raising its severed head to the sky, he shows the Holy War the true face of the Warrior-Prophet’s adversary. The hunt for Moënghus need not end.

==='''Anasûrimbor Kellhus'''===
[[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] requires three things to prepare for his father in Shimeh: knowledge of battle and of sorcery, and possession of the Holy War.

From the outset, he uses his claim to caste-nobility to insinuate himself into the councils of Proyas and the other Great Names. He proceeds cautiously, patiently laying the groundwork of his domination. From his readings of Inrithi scripture, he learns what the Men of the Tusk expect from a prophetic figure, so he sets out to emulate—as far as he can—all of those characteristics. He becomes a pilot of souls, crafting others’ impressions of him with subtle inflections of word, tone, and expression. Soon, almost all those who know him find themselves in ''awe.'' Throughout the Holy War men whisper that a prophet walks among them.

At the same time, he plies Achamian with particular care. While mining him for his knowledge of the [[Three Seas]], Kellhus subtly conditions him, instilling the passions and beliefs that will eventually force him to do the impossible: teach Kellhus the Gnosis, the deadly sorcery of the [[Ancient North]].

In the course of his study, however, he discovers dozens of skin-spies mimicking men in various positions of power. He realizes, moreover, that they now ''know'' he can see them. One of them, a high-ranking Shrial Knight called Sarcellus, approaches him, probing for details. Kellhus uses the opportunity to make himself even more enigmatic, into a puzzle the Consult will be loath to destroy before solving. As long as he remains a benign mystery to the Consult, Kellhus realizes, they will not move against him.

He needs time to consolidate his position. Until the Holy War is his, he cannot risk an open confrontation.

He says nothing to Achamian for much the same reason. He knows the Mandate Schoolman believes him to be the Harbinger of the Second Apocalypse, and that the only thing preventing Achamian from telling this to his Mandate handlers is the recent death of his former student, Inrau, as a result of their machinations. Knowing that Kellhus could actually ''see'' Consult agents in their midst would prove too much. And as Achamian himself admits, the Mandate would likely seize Kellhus rather than treat with him as an equal.

Once the Holy War secures Shigek, Kellhus begins asserting himself more and more, giving what are called the [[Sermons of the Ziggurat]]. Though many now refer to him openly as the Warrior-Prophet, he continues to insist he is simply a man like any other. Knowing that Achamian has succumbed—that he believes him to be the world’s only hope—Kellhus finally asks the Schoolman to teach him the Gnosis. But when Achamian leaves for the Sareötic Library to meditate on this request, he is abducted by the Scarlet Spires.

Assuming Achamian lost, Kellhus turns to Esmenet, not out of any errant sense of lust, but because her extraordinary native intelligence makes her useful both as a subordinate and as a potential mate. The differences between the Dûnyain and the worldborn makes his bloodline invaluable. He knows that whatever sons he produces, especially by a woman of Esmenet’s intellect, will prove powerful tools.

So he begins seducing her by teaching her to read, by showing the hidden truths of her own heart, and by drawing her ever deeper into his circle of power and influence. Far from proving an obstacle, her bereavement actually facilitates his plan by rendering her more emotionally vulnerable and prone to suggestion. By the time the Holy War enters the desert, she has willingly joined him and Serwë in their bed.

Despite its calamities, the journey across the desert provides ample opportunity for him to exercise his otherworldly abilities. He rallies the Men of the Tusk with demonstrations of indomitable will and courage. He even saves them, using his preternatural senses to find well-springs beneath the sand. By the time the remnants of the Holy War fall upon Caraskand, thousands upon thousands openly hail him as the Warrior-Prophet. At long last he yields to the title.

He names his followers the Zaudunyani, the “Tribe of Truth.”

But now he faces an added danger. As the numbers of Zaudunyani swell, so too do the misapprehensions of the Great Names. For many, following the dictates of a living—as opposed to a long-dead—prophet proves too much. Ikurei Conphas becomes the de facto leader of the Orthodox, those Men of the Tusk who repudiate Kellhus and his revisionary Inrithism. Even Proyas finds himself increasingly troubled.

The Consult, as well, have been watching Kellhus with growing trepidation. In the confusion of Caraskand’s fall, Sarcellus leads several of his brother skin-spies in an assassination attempt that very nearly costs Kellhus his life. Knowing that it might prove useful, Kellhus saves one of their severed heads.

Shortly after this attempt, Kellhus is finally contacted by one of his father’s agents: a Cishaurim fleeing the Scarlet Spires. He tells Kellhus that he follows the Shortest Path, and that soon he will comprehend something called the [[Thousandfold Thought]]. Kellhus has innumerable questions, but it is too late: the Scarlet Spires approach. To avoid compromising his position, Kellhus beheads the man.

When the Padirajah arrives and seals the Holy War up within Caraskand, the situation becomes even more dire. According to Conphas and the Orthodox, the [[God of Gods|God]] punishes the Men of the Tusk for following a False Prophet. To defuse their threat, Kellhus plots the assassination of both Conphas and Sarcellus. Neither attempt succeeds, and General [[Martemus]], Conphas’s closest adviser, is killed.

The dilemma now facing Kellhus is almost insuperable. The Holy War starves. The Zaudunyani and the Orthodox stand upon the brink of open war. And the Padirajah continues to assail Caraskand’s walls. For the first time, Kellhus is confronted by circumstances he cannot master.

He sees only one possible way to unify the Holy War under his leadership: he must let the Men of the Tusk condemn him and Serwë, and trust that Cnaiür, driven to avenge Serwë, will save him. Only a dramatic reversal and vindication can possibly win over the Orthodox in time.

He must make a leap of faith.

Serwë is executed, and Kellhus is bound to her naked corpse. Then he is lashed to a circumfix and hung from a great tree to die of exposure. Visions of the [[No-God]] plague him, as does Serwë pressed dead against him. Never has he suffered so …

For the first time, Anasûrimbor Kellhus weeps.

Achamian comes to him wild with rage because of Esmenet. Kellhus tells him about the skin-spies, about his visions of the impending Apocalypse.

Then, miraculously, he is cut down, and he knows that at last the Holy War is his, and that they will have the ardour and conviction they need to overcome the Padirajah.

Standing before the exultant masses, he grasps the Thousandfold Thought.

'''The Thousandfold Thought''' is the third novel in both ''[[The Prince of Nothing]]'' trilogy and ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]'' series. It was published in 2006.

The text of the novel was accompanied by an "Encyclopedic Glossary", an extensive guide to the people, places and history of [[Eärwa]]. A second and updated Encyclopedic Glossary was later published in ''[[The Unholy Consult]]''.

==Publisher’s Summary==
''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' R. Scott Bakker’s magnificent debut, drew thunderous acclaim from reviewers and fellow fantasy authors. Readers were invited into a darkly threatening, thrillingly imaginative universe as fully realized as that of any in modern fantasy and introduced to one of the genre’s great characters: the powerful warrior-philosopher Anasûrimbor Kellhus, on whom the fate of a violently apocalyptic Holy War rests.

Bakker’s follow up to ''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' ''The Warrior-Prophet'' enticed readers further into the richly imagined world of myth, violence, and sorcery. The startling and far-reaching answers to these questions are brought into thrilling focus in ''The Thousandfold Thought,'' the conclusion to ''The Prince of Nothing'' trilogy.

Casting into question all the action that has taken place before, twisting readers’ intuitions in unforeseen directions, remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, R. Scott Bakker has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the reader with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of fantasy literature.

'''The Judging Eye''' is the first novel in the ''[[Aspect-Emperor]]'' trilogy and the fourth in ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]'' series. It was published in 2009.

==Publisher’s Summary==
Set twenty years after the end of ''[[The Thousandfold Thought (Book)|The Thousandfold Thought]],'' Bakker reintroduces us to a world that is at once familiar but also very different than the one readers thought they knew. Delving even further into his richly imagined universe of myth, violence, and sorcery, and fully remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, ''[[R. Scott Bakker]]'' has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the reader with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of today’s literature.

==Plot Summary==
{{Tje chapters}}
==='''Drusas Achamian'''===
For twenty years [[Drusas Achamian]] has kept a painstaking record of his [[Seswatha’s Dreams]] of the [[Apocalypse|First Apocalypse]].

He lives as an exile, the world’s only [[Wizard]], on the savage northeastern frontier of the empire [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] has raised about his supposed divinity. The [[Sranc]] once besieged his half-ruined tower, but the [[Scalpoi|scalpers]] have driven the inhuman creatures over the mountains, chasing the Holy Bounty. For years now Achamian has lived in peace, hunting his sleep for hints and rumours of [[Ishuäl]], the hidden fastness of the [[Dûnyain]]. If he can find Ishuäl, he believes, he can answer the question that burns so bright in so many learned souls …

Who is the Aspect-Emperor?

This peace is shattered when [[Mimara|Anasûrimbor Mimara]], the daughter of his former wife, arrives demanding that he teach her [[sorcery]]. Her resemblance to her mother, [[Esmenet]]—who has become Empress of the [[Three Seas]]—returns the old Wizard to all the pains he sought to escape. He refuses her demand, bids her to leave time and again, but she defies him and takes up a vigil outside his tower.

Mimara, who has never forgiven her mother for selling her into childhood slavery, has fled the Imperial Court with no intention of returning. She is one of the [[The Few|Few]]. She possesses the ability to see the fabric of existence and so the power to learn sorcery—and this, she has decided, is the one thing that will lift her from the mire of shame and recrimination that is her life. She believes she has nothing else.

But she also possesses a different kind of sight, one both more precious and more significant: on rare occasions, she can see the ''morality'' of things, the goodness and the evil inherent to them. She has what the ancients called the [[Judging Eye]].

Day and night she howls at the old Wizard in his tower, demanding that he teach her. The first time he comes down, he strikes her. The second time he tries to reason with her. He explains his lifelong quest to discover the truth of Anasûrimbor Kellhus—her stepfather. He seeks the location of Ishuäl because it is the Aspect-Emperor’s birthplace, and the truth of a man, he insists, always lies in his origins. He tells her how his Dreams have slowly transformed, abandoning the epic atrocities of the First Apocalypse and focusing more and more upon the mundane details of [[Seswatha]]’s ancient life. Because of this, he now knows ''how'' to find Ishuäl: he must recover a map that lies hidden in the ruins of ancient [[Sauglish]], far to the north.

“You have become a prophet,” she tells him. “A prophet of the past.”

And then, in yet one more attempt to win his tutelage, she seduces him.

Only in the shameful aftermath does she tell the old Wizard that he has dwelt upon his suspicions for too long. The Aspect-Emperor has already embarked on his quest to destroy the [[Consult]] and so save the world from a Second Apocalypse. The [[Great Ordeal]] marches.

Achamian abandons Mimara at his tower and strikes out for the nearest scalper outpost. Here he contracts a company called the [[Skin Eaters]] to join his quest, deceiving them with promises of the [[Coffers]], the [[Library of Sauglish|Holy Library]]’s famed treasury. The Captain of the company, a Veteran of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]] named [[Kosoter|Lord Kosoter]], troubles him, as does [[Nil’giccas|Incariol]], his mysterious [[Nonmen|Nonman]] companion, but time is short, and he can think of no one else who would accompany him on such a mad trek. He must somehow reach the Library of Sauglish, and thence Ishuäl, before the Great Ordeal reaches the gates of [[Golgotterath]]. The scalpers company departs shortly thereafter, planning to cross the [[Osthwai Mountains]] into the Sranc-infested North.

Mimara is not so easily dissuaded. She shadows the scalpers without appreciating the cunning of their forest craft. She is discovered, and Achamian is forced to save her, saying that she is his wilful daughter. Fearing that she will reveal his true purposes, he at last relents. He allows her to accompany him on his quest and agrees to teach her sorcery.

Shortly after, they learn that a spring blizzard has closed the passes through the Osthwai Mountains, perhaps delaying them for weeks—for too long. Only one path remains open to them: the accursed halls of [[Cil-Aujas]].

They camp before the entrance to the derelict Nonman Mansion, plagued with apprehensions. Then, with the coming of dawn, they descend into the heart of the mountain. For days they wander the wrecked halls, led by Incariol and his ancient memories. Deep in the Mansion, Mimara finally confesses her sporadic ability to see the morality of things, and Achamian, obviously troubled, tells her that she possesses the Judging Eye. She presses him to tell her more, but the old Wizard refuses. Before she can berate him properly, the company discovers that it is not alone in the Mansion.

Sranc assail them with fury and countless numbers. Despite the sorcerous toll exacted by Incariol and Achamian, the company is overcome, and the survivors are forced to flee down into the bowels of Cil-Aujas. Achamian is knocked unconscious by a Sranc bearing a [[Chorae]]. Mimara kills the creature and pockets the thing. They flee through the mines that riddle the foundations of the mountain and find themselves on the scorched rim of a burning lake. The Sranc pour after them, a howling tide. They flee along a stair and would certainly perish were it not for Incariol and his sorcerous might. Their route sealed behind them, they find themselves in an ancient slave pit, huddling among the bones of a dead [[Wracu|Dragon]]. Only a handful survive.

While they recover themselves, Incariol dispenses [[qirri]], an ancient Nonman remedy. Mimara finds herself staring at her Chorae. It is an abomination in her sorcerous eyes, yet she persists gazing. The Judging Eye opens, and the thing is miraculously transformed. Suddenly she ''sees'' it for what it truly is: a white burning Tear of [[God of Gods|God]]. She turns to [[Somandutta]], the scalper who has become her protector with the Wizard incapacitated. But he sees nothing …

Then she notices the stranger sitting in their midst.

Incariol recognizes the figure as the shade of [[Gin’yursis]], the ancient Nonman King of Cil-Aujas. The wraith dons the Nonman as if he were clothing. While the company stands watching in dread, the qirri finally revives the old Wizard. Recognizing their peril, he begins screaming at them to flee.

Again they race into the black, while something dark and nebulous pursues them. In desperation, Achamian brings the ceiling crashing down, sealing the company even deeper within the doomed Mansion.

They find themselves at the bottom of a vast well, what Achamian remembers as the Great Medial Screw from his ancient Dreams, a stair that plumbs the whole mountain. The sky is little more than a prick of light above them. The battered Skin Eaters rejoice. All they need do is climb …

But Gin’yursis rises from the deeps to claim them, dragging Hell itself as his mantle.

Mimara’s Judging Eye opens. She raises high her brilliant Tear of God …

==='''The Great Ordeal'''===
Far to the north, young [[Varalt Sorweel]] finds himself staring down upon the boggling might of the Southron Believer-Kings. He is the only son of [[Varalt Harweel II]], the King of [[Sakarpus]], who has resisted the Aspect-Emperor’s demand to yield his ancient city and its famed Chorae Hoard. Standing with his father on the high curtain walls, the adolescent realizes that he and his people are doomed. Then, miraculously, a stork—a bird that is holy to the Sakarpi—appears on the battlements above his father. The two commune in the charged silence that follows, then King Harweel turns and commands that Sorweel be taken to safety. “See that no harm comes to him!” he cries. “He will be our final sword-stroke! Our vengeance!” Dragged away screaming, the young man watches sorcerous flames engulf the parapets and his father upon them. A desperate flight ensues, and it seems that the ''Aspect-Emperor himself'' pursues them through the chaotic streets.

The pursuit ends in the apparent safety of the citadel. Blasting through walls, Anasûrimbor Kellhus effortlessly kills his protectors. He approaches the adolescent Prince, but rather than seizing or striking him, he ''embraces'' him. Tells him that he is forgiven.

The city secure, the Great Ordeal prepares for the long march across the trackless wilds. Sorweel finds himself desolate for the loss of his father and the shame of his new circumstances. As the new King of Sakarpus, he is naught but a tool of the [[New Empire]], a way for the Aspect-Emperor to legitimize his tyranny. Before the host departs, none other than [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II]] and [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas]], the eldest sons of Anasûrimbor Kellhus, visit him in his palace. They tell him he is to join the Ordeal as the symbol of his nation’s commitment to their holy cause. The following day Sorweel finds himself part of the Scions, a horse company composed of princely hostages from across the rim of the New Empire. This is how he meets and befriends [[Zsoronga ut Nganka’kull]], the Successor Prince of [[Zeüm]].

A [[Mandate]] sorcerer named [[Thanteus Eskeles]] is assigned to tutor him in Sheyic, the common tongue of the Three Seas, and through him the young King learns the reasons why so many worship the Aspect-Emperor so fervently. For the first time he begins to doubt his father … What if the Aspect-Emperor spoke true? What if the world ''really'' was about to end?

Why else would someone so cunning march so many Men to their doom?

Sorweel is also provided a slave named [[Porsparian]] to attend to his needs, a wizened old man who is anything but the submissive thrall he pretends to be. One night Sorweel watches him tear away the turf and mould the face of the Goddess [[Yatwer]] from the dirt. Before his eyes, mud bubbles up as spit from her earthen lips. The slave palms this mud and smears it across the incredulous King’s cheeks.

The following morning Sorweel attends a Council of Potentates with Zsoronga and Eskeles. His dread waxes as he watches the Holy Aspect-Emperor move from lord to lord, declaring the truths they think hidden in their souls. He fears what will happen when he sees the hatred and treachery smouldering in his own. But when Anasûrimbor Kellhus comes to him, he ''congratulates'' Sorweel for grasping the truth and, before everyone assembled, declares him one of the Believer-Kings.

==='''Esmenet'''===
Far to the south in [[Momemn]], the capital of the New Empire, Esmenet struggles to rule in her husband’s absence. With Kellhus and the bulk of his armed might absent, the embers of insurrection have begun to ignite across the Three Seas. The Imperial Court regards her with condescension. [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]], the [[Padirajah]] of what had been the heathen [[Kian]]ene Empire before the First Holy War, grows ever more bold on the fringes of the Great [[Carathay Desert]]. [[Psatma Nannaferi]], the outlawed Mother-Supreme of the [[The Cult of Yatwer|Cult of Yatwer]], prophesies the coming of the [[White-Luck Warrior]], the god-sent assassin who will murder the Aspect-Emperor and his progeny. Even the ''[[Gods]],'' it seems, have turned against the [[Anasûrimbor Dynasty]]. Esmenet turns to her brother-in-law, [[Maithanet|Anasûrimbor Maithanet]], the [[Shriah]] of the [[Thousand Temples]], for his clarity of vision and strength, yet she wonders why her husband would leave the Mantle in ''her'' incapable hands, when his brother is Dûnyain like himself.

She also has the travails of her own family to contend with. All her eldest children have gone. Mimara has fled—to Achamian, she hopes and prays. Anasûrimbor Kayûtas, [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]], and her stepson, Anasûrimbor Moënghus II, ride with their father in the Great Ordeal. [[Anasûrimbor Theliopa]] remains with her as an adviser, but the girl is scarcely human, she is so narrow and analytical. The next youngest, the mad and murderous [[Anasûrimbor Inrilatas]], Esmenet keeps imprisoned atop the [[Andiamine Heights]]. Only her very youngest, the twins [[Anasûrimbor Samarmas]] and [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas]], provide her with any comfort. She clings to them as if they were flotsam in a shipwreck, not realizing that Kelmomas, like his brother Inrilatas, has inherited too many of his father’s gifts. The boy has already driven away Mimara with the cunning of his insinuations. Now he plots deeper ways to secure sole possession of his mother’s heart.

He will tolerate no rivals.

In the city of [[Iothiah]], meanwhile, the White-Luck Warrior reveals himself to Psatma Nannaferi, who summons all her High Priestesses to plot the destruction of the Anasûrimbor. None other than Yatwer, the monstrous Mother of Birth, moves against the Aspect-Emperor. As the Goddess most favoured by slaves and [[caste]]-menials, she commands tremendous temporal power. Unrest spreads among the servile poor.

Even as the first rumours of this sedition reach his mother in Momemn, young Kelmomas continues his own devious insurrection. Where before he had driven Mimara away, now he engineers the death of his idiot twin, Samarmas, knowing that grief for his loss will make his mother even more desperate for his love.

Capsized by the death of Samarmas, bewildered by the possibility that the Hundred themselves now hunt her family, Esmenet turns to her brother-in-law, Maithanet. He reminds her that the Gods can see neither the [[No-God]] nor the coming Apocalypse and so perceive her husband as a threat instead of a saviour.

At his bidding, Esmenet summons [[Hanamem Sharacinth]], the officially sanctioned Matriarch of the Yatwerians, with the intention of setting the Cult against itself. When they fail to cow the woman, Kellhus himself arrives and breaks her will to resist with sheer force of presence. The blubbering Matriarch yields, promising to wrest her Cult from Psatma Nannaferi. The Aspect-Emperor returns to the Great Ordeal, dismaying his Empress with his indifference to their son’s death.

Realizing that his mother turns to him the more circumstances turn against her, Kelmomas sets out that very night, using his Dûnyain blood to steal across the [[Imperial Precincts]], and murders Sharacinth and her retinue.

Rumours of her assassination travel quickly, igniting the embers of sedition among the slaves and caste-menials. Riots erupt across the New Empire.

Esmenet does turn to Kelmomas for comfort. At night, she takes to embracing him in her bed while the smell of smoke and the sound of screams and shouts waft through windows. Intoxicated with success, the young Prince-Imperial begins plotting against his uncle, Maithanet, knowing that the man alone possesses the ability to see through his deception.

'''''The Unholy Consult''''' is the fourth and final novel in the ''[[Aspect-Emperor]]'' series and the seventh in ''[[The Second Apocalypse]]'' cycle.

R. Scott Bakker finished the final manuscript and delivered it to his publishers in January of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rsbakker.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/earth-and-muck/ Earth and Muck]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''The Unholy Consult'' was intended to be the third and final novel in the ''Aspect-Emperor'' trilogy, however, due to the manuscripts length the book was split into two volumes{{dash}}the first being ''[[The Great Ordeal (Book)|The Great Ordeal]]'' and the second ''The Unholy Consult''.

As well as the text of the novel, the book also contains a second "Encyclopedic Glossary", an updated and expanded version of the glossary published as part of ''[[The Thousandfold Thought]]''. The book also included two short stories, ''[[The False Sun]]'' and ''[[The Four Revelations of Cinial’jin]]'', in this volume renamed simply as ''Four Revelations''.

The books tracks the movement of the [[Great Ordeal]] ever closer to [[Golgotterath]], its men maddened by the use of [[Sranc]] meat for sustenance, of Sorweel and [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]] and their journey that spirals ever closer to chaos, and of [[Drusas Achamian]] and [[Mimara]], as well as the [[Aspect-Emperor]] himself, as he embarks on a mysterious quest of his own, leaving [[Nersei Proyas]] alone to command the Ordealmen. Proyas must control the masses, and the horns of Golgotterath loom ever closer...

[[File:Kellhussssss.png|thumb|241x241px]]
'''Anasûrimbor Kellhus''' was a former [[Dûnyain]] Monk and, as of the year 4112 ([[Year-of-the-Tusk]]), [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] of the [[Three Seas]]. His [[New Empire]] spanned the entirety of the Three Seas and he lead the [[Great Ordeal]] across the [[Ancient North]] in an effort to directly seek out and destroy the [[Consult]], before it was destroyed before [[Golgotterath]] in 4132.

==Character and appearance==
Kellhus was tall and strong, with blonde hair and blue eyes. He had a long, heavy-featured and aquiline face. He wore his hair long, with a close-cropped beard. His features and voice were very similar to those of his father.{{3|15}} Like all Dûnyain, Kellhus exhibited extraordinary powers of deduction and persuasion allowing him to manipulate worldborn [[Men]] as if they were children.{{1|P}} His command of the [[Gnosis]] was second to none, making him the most powerful sorcerer in the Three Seas, and—possibly—in the entirety of [[Eärwa]].

==Background==
Kellhus was born in [[Ishuäl]], a fortress built in the Ancient North by [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]] but occupied by the Dûnyain for almost two thousand years. In Ishuäl, the Dûnyain isolated themselves from the world, breeding for reflex and intellect, and continually training in the ways of limb, thought, and face—all for the sake of reason, what they call the [[Logos]]. In an effort to transform themselves into the perfect expression of the Logos, the Dûnyain bent their entire existence to mastering the irrationalities that determine human thought: history, custom, and passion. In this way, they believe, they will eventually grasp what they call the [[Absolute]], and so become true self-moving souls.{{EG|Dûnyain}}

Kellhus was a prodigy even by Dûnyain standards. Before he left Ishuäl, his understanding of the true nature of Eärwa was very limited as the Dûnyain had suppressed knowledge of [[Sorcery]] and other metaphysical phenomena.{{1|P}}

==Story==
===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Kellhus is sent by his order, the Dûnyain, to search for his father, [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]], who left them some thirty years previous. Knowing only that his father dwells in the city of [[Shimeh]], Kellhus undertakes the arduous journey travelling through the abandoned North. Eventually he succumbs and is saved by a trapper named [[Leweth]]. While wintering with Leweth, Kellhus discovers he can read the man’s thoughts through the nuances of his expression. World-born men, he realizes, are little more than children in comparison with the Dûnyain. Experimenting, he finds that he can exact anything from Leweth — any love, any sacrifice — with mere words.{{1|P}}

{{Blockquote|No one’s soul moves alone, Leweth. When one love dies, one must learn to love another.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{1|P}}}}

When a band of [[Sranc]] discovers Leweth’s steading, the two men are forced to flee. Leweth is wounded, and Kellhus leaves him for the Sranc, feeling no remorse. The Sranc overtake him, and after driving them away, he battles their leader, a deranged [[Nonman]], who nearly kills Kellhus with sorcery. Kellhus flees, wracked by questions without answers: sorcery, he’d been taught, was nothing more than superstition.{{1|P}}

Eventually he finds refuge in the ancient city of [[Atrithau]], where, using his Dûnyain abilities, he assembles an expedition of forty-seven men to traverse the Sranc-infested plains of [[Suskara]]. The men call themselves ''adunyani'', meaning ‘little Dûnyain’. After a harrowing trek that only he survives, he crosses the frontier only to be captured by a mad [[Scylvendi]] Chieftain named [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] — a man who both knows and hates his father, Moënghus. Though his knowledge of the Dûnyain renders Cnaiür immune to direct manipulation, Kellhus realizes he can turn the man’s thirst for vengeance to his advantage. Claiming to be an assassin sent to murder Moënghus, he asks the Scylvendi to join him on his quest. Overpowered by his hatred, Cnaiür reluctantly agrees, and the two men set out across the [[Jiünati Steppe]]. Kellhus tries to secure the trust he needs to possess the man, but the barbarian continually rebuffs him. His hatred and penetration are too great.{{1|12}}{{1|13}}

{{Blockquote|The Dûnyain, have surrendered themselves to the [[Logos]], to what you would call reason and intellect. We seek absolute awareness, the self-moving thought. The thoughts of all men arise from the darkness. If you ''are'' the movement of your soul, and the ''cause'' of that movement precedes you, then how could you ever call your thoughts your own? How could you ''be'' anything other than a slave to the darkness that comes before? Only the Logos allows one to mitigate that slavery. Only knowing the sources of thought and action allows us to own our thoughts and our actions, to throw off the yoke of circumstance. And only the Dûnyain possess this knowledge, plainsman. The world slumbers, enslaved by its ignorance. Only the Dûnyain are ''awake''. Moënghus, my father, threatens this.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{1|12}}}}

Then, near the Imperial frontier, they find a concubine named [[Serwë]], who informs them of a [[Holy War]] gathering about [[Momemn]] — a Holy War for Shimeh. They cross the mountains into the [[Nansur|Empire]], and Kellhus watches Cnaiür struggle with the growing conviction that he’s outlived his usefulness. Thinking that murdering Kellhus is as close as he’ll ever come to murdering Moënghus, Cnaiür attacks him, only to be defeated. To prove that he still needs him, Kellhus spares his life. He must, Kellhus knows, dominate the Holy War, but he as yet knows nothing of warfare. The variables are too many. Though his knowledge of Moënghus and the Dûnyain renders him a liability, Cnaiür’s skill in war makes him invaluable. To secure this knowledge, Kellhus starts seducing Serwë, using her and her beauty as detours to the barbarian’s tormented heart.{{1|13}}

Once in the Empire, they stumble across a patrol of Imperial cavalrymen; their journey to Momemn quickly becomes a desperate race.{{1|14}} When they finally reach the encamped Holy War they find themselves before [[Nersei Proyas]], the Crown Prince of [[Conriya]]. To secure a position of honour among the [[Men of the Tusk]], Kellhus lies, and claims to be a Prince of Atrithau. To lay the groundwork for his future domination, he claims to have suffered dreams of the Holy War. Since Proyas is more concerned with Cnaiür and how he can use the barbarian’s knowledge of battle to thwart the Emperor, these declarations are accepted without any real scrutiny. Only the [[Mandate]] Schoolman accompanying Proyas, [[Drusas Achamian]], seems troubled by him — especially by his name.{{1|15}}

The following evening, Kellhus dines with the sorcerer, disarming him with humour, flattering him with questions. He learns of the [[First Apocalypse|Apocalypse]] and the Consult and many other sundry things, and though he knows Achamian harbours some terror regarding the name ‘Anasûrimbor’, he asks the melancholy man to become his teacher. The Dûnyain, Kellhus has come to realize, have been mistaken about many things, the existence of sorcery among them. There is so much he must know before he confronts his father.{{1|16}}

A final gathering is called to settle the issue between the lords of the Holy War, who want to march, and the [[Ikurei Xerius III|Emperor]], who refuses to provision them. With Cnaiür at his side, Kellhus charts the souls of all those present, calculating the ways he might bring them under his thrall. Among the Emperor’s advisers, however, he observes an expression he cannot read. The man, he realizes, possesses a false face. While [[Ikurei Conphas]] and the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] caste-nobles bicker, Kellhus studies the man, and determines that his name is [[Skeaös]] by reading the lips of his interlocutors.{{1|17}}

Before he can draw any conclusions, however, his scrutiny is noticed by the Emperor himself, who has the adviser seized. Though the entire Holy War celebrates the Emperor’s defeat, Kellhus is more perplexed than ever. Never has he undertaken a study so deep.{{1|17}} That night he consummates his relationship with Serwë, continuing the patient work of undoing Cnaiür — as all Men of the Tusk must be undone. Somewhere, a shadowy faction lurks behind faces of false skin. Far to the south in Shimeh, Anasûrimbor Moënghus awaits the coming storm.{{1|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Warrior Prophet]]'', Book I synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Warrior Prophet''===
Kellhus requires three things to prepare for his father in Shimeh: knowledge of battle and of sorcery, and possession of the Holy War. From the outset, he uses his claim to caste-nobility to insinuate himself into the councils of Proyas and the other Great Names. He proceeds cautiously, patiently laying the groundwork of his domination. From his readings of Inrithi scripture, he learns what the Men of the Tusk expect from a prophetic figure, so he sets out to emulate — as far as he can—all of those characteristics. He becomes a pilot of souls, crafting others' impressions of him with subtle inflections of word, tone, and expression. Soon, almost all those who know him find themselves in awe. Throughout the Holy War men whisper that a prophet walks among them.

At the same time, he plies Achamian with particular care. While mining him for his knowledge of the Three Seas, Kellhus subtly conditions him, instilling the passions and beliefs that will eventually force him to do the impossible: teach Kellhus the [[Gnosis]], the deadly sorcery of the Ancient North. In the course of his study, however, he discovers dozens of [[skin-spies]] mimicking men in various positions of power. He realizes, moreover, that they now know he can see them. One of them, a high-ranking [[Shrial Knights|Shrial Knight]] called [[Cutias Sarcellus|Sarcellus]], approaches him, probing for details. Kellhus uses the opportunity to make himself even more enigmatic, into a puzzle the Consult will be loath to destroy before solving. As long as he remains a benign mystery to the Consult, Kellhus realizes, they will not move against him. He needs time to consolidate his position. Until the Holy War is his, he cannot risk an open confrontation.

He says nothing to Achamian for much the same rea­son. He knows the Mandate Schoolman believes him to be the [[Harbinger]] of the [[Second Apocalypse]], and that the only thing preventing Achamian from telling this to his Mandate handlers is the recent death of his former student, [[Paro Inrau|Inrau]], as a result of their machinations. Knowing that Kellhus could actually see Consult agents in their midst would prove too much. And as Achamian himself admits, the Mandate would likely seize Kellhus rather than treat with him as an equal.

Once the Holy War secures [[Shigek]], Kellhus begins asserting himself more and more, giving what are called the [[Sermons of the Ziggurat]]. Though many now refer to him openly as the [[Warrior-Prophet (title)|Warrior-Prophet]], he continues to insist he is simply a man like any other. Knowing that Achamian has succumbed—that he believes him to be the world's only hope — Kellhus finally asks the Schoolman to teach him the Gnosis. But when Achamian leaves for the [[Sareötic Library]] to meditate on this request, he is abducted by the [[Scarlet Spires]].

Assuming Achamian lost, Kellhus turns to [[Esmenet]], not out of any errant sense of lust, but because her extraordinary native intelligence makes her useful both as a subordinate and as a potential mate. The differences between the Dûnyain and the worldborn makes his bloodline invaluable. He knows that whatever sons he produces, especially by a woman of Esmenet’s intellect, will prove powerful tools. So he begins seducing her by teaching her to read, by showing the hidden truths of her own heart, and by draw­ing her ever deeper into his circle of power and influence. Far from proving an obstacle, her bereavement actually facili­tates his plan by rendering her more emotionally vulnerable and prone to suggestion. By the time the Holy War enters the desert, she has willingly joined him and Serwë in their bed. Despite its calamities, the journey across the desert pro­vides ample opportunity for him to exercise his otherworldly abilities. He rallies the Men of the Tusk with demonstra­tions of indomitable will and courage. He even saves them, using his preternatural senses to find well-springs beneath the sand. By the time the remnants of the Holy War fall upon [[Caraskand]], thousands upon thousands openly hail him as the Warrior-Prophet. At long last he yields to the title. He names his followers the [[Zaudunyani]], the ‘Tribe of Truth’.

But now he faces an added danger. As the numbers of Zaudunyani swell, so too do the misapprehensions of the Great Names. For many, following the dictates of a living — as opposed to a long-dead — prophet proves too much. [[Ikurei Conphas]] becomes the de facto leader of the Orthodox, those Men of the Tusk who repudiate Kellhus and his revisionary Inrithism. Even Proyas finds himself increasingly troubled. The Consult, as well, have been watching Kellhus with growing trepidation. In the confusion of Caraskand’s fall, Sarcellus leads several of his brother skin-spies in an assas­sination attempt that very nearly costs Kellhus his life. Knowing that it might prove useful, Kellhus saves one of their severed heads.
Shortly after this attempt, Kellhus is finally contacted by one of his father’s agents: a [[Cishaurim]] fleeing the Scarlet Spires. He tells Kellhus that he follows the [[Shortest Path]], and that soon he will comprehend something called the [[Thousandfold Thought]]. Kellhus has innumerable questions, but it is too late: the Scarlet Spires approach. To avoid compromising his position, Kellhus beheads the man.

When the [[Kascamandri ab Tepherokar|Padirajah]] arrives and seals the Holy War up within Caraskand, the situation becomes even more dire. According to Conphas and the Orthodox, the God punishes the Men of the Tusk for following a False Prophet. To defuse their threat, Kellhus plots the assassination of both Conphas and Sarcellus. Neither attempt succeeds, and General [[Martemus]], Conphas’s closest adviser, is killed. The dilemma now facing Kellhus is almost insuperable. The Holy War starves. The Zaudunyani and the Orthodox stand upon the brink of open war. And the Padirajah con­tinues to assail Caraskand’s walls. For the first time, Kellhus is confronted by circumstances he cannot master. He sees only one possible way to unify the Holy War under his leadership: he must let the Men of the Tusk condemn him and Serwë, and trust that Cnaiür, driven to avenge Serwë, will save him. Only a dramatic reversal and vindication can possibly win over the Orthodox in time.

He must make a leap of faith.

Serwë is executed, and Kellhus is bound to her naked corpse. Then he is lashed to a circumfix and hung from a [[Umiaki|great tree]] to die of exposure. Visions of the [[No-God]] plague him, as does Serwë pressed dead against him. Never has he suffered so... For the first time, Anasûrimbor Kellhus weeps. Achamian comes to him wild with rage because of Esmenet. Kellhus tells him about the skin-spies, about his visions of the impending Apocalypse. Then, miraculously, he is cut down, and he knows that at last the Holy War is his, and that they will have the ardour and conviction they need to overcome the Padirajah.

Standing before the exultant masses, he grasps the Thousandfold Thought.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Thousandfold Thought]]'', Book II synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
Kellhus asks Achamian to teach him the Gnosis again. Though Achamian had been ordered by his Mandate handlers to pretend to give Kellhus the Gnosis and to make sure that no harm comes to him, he agrees but reminds Kellhus that sorcerers are vulnerable to [[Chorae]], Kellhus then insists that Achamian must become his Vizier to be better able to protect him.{{3|1}} Kellhus tells Achamian that with him the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]] is rewritten so that sorcerers are no longer damned.{{3|4}} When the Holy War is about to leave Caraskand and continue its march toward Shimeh, Kellhus orders Cnaiür to stay in [[Joktha]] with Conphas, in order to kill him.{{3|3}}

As the Holy War continues its march, Achamian teaches Kellhus [[Gilcûnya]], the arcane tongue of the Nonmen [[Qûya]] and the language of all the Gnostic Cants. Kellhus astonishes Achamian by learning the language in less than two weeks. The two discuss the metaphysics of the Gnosis and other sorcery, and Kellhus asks Achamian whether Cants of three strings, one utteral and two inutterals, have been devised. Achamian lies and says that it’s impossible. When Achamian attempts to teach Kellhus the Cants of Calling he realizes that [[Seswatha]] prevents him. Only after Kellhus “speaks” with Seswatha is Achamian able to depart knowledge of the Gnosis.{{3|6}} Again, Kellhus claims that sorcerers are no longer damned.{{3|10}}

{{Blockquote|The old revelations have outlived the age of their intention, and I have come to reveal the new. I am the Shortest Path, and I say that you are ''not damned''.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{3|10}}}}

In [[Amoteu]], Esmenet is possessed by the [[Inchoroi]], [[Aurang]], and confronts Kellhus with questions about the Dûnyain and his father. Kellhus at first answers it but then realizes that the Inchoroi had used some sorcery on him and casts a Dara Ward to free himself of its influence. Kellhus baits Aurang by telling him that the No-God says that he failed him on the Plains of [[Mengedda]].{{3|12}}

Before the Holy War assaults Shimeh Kellhus leaves to meet his father in [[Kyudea]]. Cnaiür reveals to Achamian the truth about Kellhus, that he is Dûnyain and that he was summoned by his father, not sent.{{3|14}}

Kellhus enters a ruined Nonman [[Mansion]] where his father is waiting for him. Inside he follows a trail that had been scuffed in the dust. The mansion’s galleries remind Kellhus of Ishuäl’s [[Thousand Thousand Halls]]. He continues following the trail and it leads him to a balcony overlooking an immense cavern with curtains of water falling down from above. Below he sees points of light and a platform beyond the reach of the waterfall. He descends a mighty staircase which leads to a vast chamber with a pool in its center. Kellhus advances around the pool and finds his father, white-skinned and pale, sitting cross-legged behind sheets of water that pour from one of a series of immense bronze statues erected in a semi-circle and facing the pool.{{3|15}}

Moënghus begins to recount Kellhus’s journey, how he came to dominate the Men of the Tusk and the Holy War, but says that the probability trance failed him at the point where the caste nobility moved against him, the Circumfixion. Kellhus tells Moënghus about the visions, the voice of God and the halos around his hands.{{3|15}} Moënghus realizes that Kellhus has been broken by his trial, that he has returned to him a ‘madman’. Kellhus begins retelling the story of how Moënghus arrived at Shimeh after leaving Ishuäl. He says that his father made a mistake by taking the Psûkhe, as it is a metaphysics of the heart — of passion — something a Dûnyain would be weak at, and that this is why Moënghus had to ask for his son to help him.{{3|16}}

{{blockquote|So you let them blind you, only to find your powers pro­portionate to your vestigial passions. What you thought to be the Shortest Path was in fact a dead end.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{3|16}}}}

Moënghus takes Kellhus to a room where he holds two captive skin-spies. The skin-spies had been first discovered by the Cishaurim about twelve years prior, Kellhus deduces. The Cishaurim, assuming this was the work of the Scarlet Spires, assassinate their Grandmaster, [[Sasheoka]]. Only Moënghus realized that the skin-spies weren’t sorcerous artifacts, but engines of flesh. So he kept the creatures and interrogated them for years, learning from them about [[Golgotterath]] and the Consult — about the Second Apocalypse. Kellhus realizes that his father poses a threat, if Moënghus were to learn of the damnation that awaits him he would be no different from the Inchoroi. He stabs his father and leaves the mansion using the Cant of Transposition just as Cnaiür and ‘Serwë’ are about to enter the room. Kellhus appears on the battlefield over Shimeh and destroys what remains of the Cishaurim.{{3|16}}

Once Shimeh has been taken, Maithanet declares Kellhus the High King of [[Kûniüri]] and Ascpect-Emperor of the Three Seas. Achamian arrives at his court and repudiates him. Kellhus tells him that the next time they meet, Achamian will kneel to him.{{3|17}}

===''The Judging Eye''===
Since the conclusion of the First Holy War Kellhus has unified the Three Seas under his rule. After twenty years of conversion and bloodshed, he plots the conclusion of his father’s Thousandfold Thought. His New Empire spans the entirety of the Three Seas, from the legendary fortress of [[Auvangshei]] on the frontiers of [[Zeüm]] to the shrouded headwaters of the [[River Sayut]], from the sweltering coasts of [[Kutnarmu]] to the wild rim of the [[Osthwai Mountains]]—all the lands that had once been Fanim or Inrithi. It was easily the equal of the old [[Ceneian Empire]] in terms of geographical extent and likely far greater when it came to population.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The White-Luck Warrior]]'', Book IV synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;

He's had four sons and two daughters with Esmenet.

During that time, Kellhus established the first School for Sorceresses in Eärwa’s history, the [[Swayal Compact]], which is lead by his daughter, [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]].{{4|2}}

He has entrusted the Empire to his wife Esmenet as he leads a Holy War against the Consult, the Great Ordeal, which is about to commence its assault on [[Sakarpus]] following [[Varalt Harweel II|Harweel]]’s refusal to surrender the city. Before the battle begins, Harweel warns his son, [[Varalt Sorweel|Sorweel]], that the Aspect-Emperor is a Demon [[Ciphrang]], a hunger from the [[Outside]]. Once the battle begins, Harweel is killed and Sorweel flees, pursued by Kellhus himself who effortlessly kills his protectors.{{4|1}}

{{Blockquote|Mourn, grieve as all Men must. But take heart in the fact of your forgiveness.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{4|1}}}}

He approaches the adolescent Prince, but rather than seizing or striking him, he ''embraces'' him. Tells him that he is forgiven, not by him, but by his father. Kellhus says that he is no conqueror — he really did come to save Mankind.{{4|1}}

Kellhus seems to have turned the Gods against him as [[Yatwer]], the Goddess of Birth, sends her ‘son’, the [[White-Luck Warrior]], into the world with the intent of killing the Aspect-Emperor.{{4|5}} When Sharacinth, the Matriarch of the [[Cult of Yatwer]] is summoned to the [[Andiamine Heights]] by Esmenet, Kellhus appears and breaks her will with his sheer force of presence, making her promise to wrest the Cult from [[Psatma Nannaferi]]. Kellhus speaks to Esmenet alone, and seems indifferent to the death of their son, [[Anasûrimbor Samarmas|Samarmas]]. He tells her that the Great Ordeal is all that matters before leaving her again.{{4|9}}

At a Council of Potentates Kellhus moves from lord to lord, declaring the truths they think hidden in their souls. One of the lords assembled, Varalt Sorweel, fears what will happen when Kellhus sees the hatred and treachery smouldering in his own. But when Kellhus comes to him, he ''congratulates'' him for grasping the truth and, before everyone assembled, declares him one of the Believer-Kings.{{4|15}}

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
Kellhus speaks with Nersei Proyas, one of the Exalt-Generals of the Great Ordeal, in his bed chamber. He tells him that the God has allowed him glimpses of the future, and that everything has unfolded in accordance with those glimpses thus far. He says that he has to make decisions he would rather not make alone, dark decisions. Kellhus commands Proyas to bow his head into the flames of his hearth, revealing that Kellhus is able to watch the Men of the Great Ordeal through his fire. Kellhus fears that if the Men of the Ordeal were to learn that the New Empire, the world they’ve left behind in hopes of saving, is slipping into ruin, his host would dissolve — collapse. So he forbids, on pain of death, all Cants of Far-calling.{{5|2}}

{{Blockquote|Henceforth, the Men of the Ordeal shall march with only memories to warm them.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{5|2}}}}

Kellhus says that even ''he'' will not maintain contact with his Empire, he can no longer afford to look back. At the Eleventh Council of Potentates, Kellhus declares the Breaking of the Great Ordeal. The host is divided into four groups: the Men of the Middle North, under the command of his son, [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas]]; the [[Ketyai]] of the East, under Nersei Proyas’s command; the Ketyai of the West, under [[Coithus Saubon]]’s command; and the Ketyai of the south under the command of King [[Sasal Umrapathur]].{{5|2}}

Kellhus, again, summons Proyas to his bed chamber to sit and discuss, as he does at least once a week. They talk about the day Drusas Achamian repudiated Kellhus in Shimeh twenty years prior, that day troubles Proyas as Achamian is someone that he once loved. Proyas had read a summary of the charges made by Achamian against Anasûrimbor Kellhus in the ''[[Compendium of the First Holy War]]'', charges that he says he did not believe. Kellhus, however, tells him that the charges are true.{{5|7}}

{{Blockquote|But that is only the man you know, the Lesser Proyas. The man I know, the Greater Proyas, I hold in shackles of iron. I am ''Dûnyain'', my friend, exactly as Achamian claimed. To merely stand in my presence is to be enslaved.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{5|10}}}}

Kellhus informs Proyas that the Nonman King of [[Injor-Niyas]], has finally answered their call; he has sent them an embassy. Kellhus is to meet the emissary in the [[Eleven Pole Chamber]], before the meeting Kellhus reminds Proyas to forgive the Nonmen their peculiarities and to beware their beauty. The emissary, [[Nin’sariccas]], arrives claiming to have been sent by [[Nil’giccas]]. Kellhus asks the Nonman whether [[Ishterebinth]] sides with the Great Ordeal, the Nonman, however, reminds him of his forefathers’ treachery, saying that for them, “Anasûrimbor” is the very name of Mannish arrogance and disorder. Kellhus repeats the question and the Nonman says that Ishterebinth will side with the Ordeal on the condition that [[Dagliash]] be retaken and the ‘[[Niom]]’ be honoured. Kellhus agrees. Toward the end of their meeting the Nonman asks Kellhus why the ‘False Men’, as the Nonmen are known in the Tusk, should lend their strength to the ‘True’, to which Kellhus replies by reminding him of the [[Womb-Plague]].{{5|10}}

{{Blockquote|Because of [[Hanalinqû]]. Because of [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]. Because four thousand years ago, all your wives and daughters were murdered... and you were cursed to go mad in the shadow of that memory, to live forever, dying their deaths.|Anasûrimbor Kellhus{{5|10}}&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;In this scene, Kellhus implies that the [[Womb-Plague]] happened four thousand years prior to his meeting with the Nonman. This is likely a mistake. The correct number is closer to ''five thousand''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Niom is a ritual wherein the ancient Nonmen Kings demanded hostages of the Men they dealt with as guarantees: a son, a daughter, and a captive enemy. The two former as a surety against treachery. The latter as a surety against deception. So Kellhus sends them his daughter Serwa, together with Sorweel and his adopted son [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II|Moënghus II]].{{5|10}}

After the [[Second Battle of the Horde]], Kellhus declares the Breaking of the Ordeal undone and commands the Armies of the West and the East to converge upon the Army of the Middle-North. Once the armies have gathered, Kellhus calls on his Believer-Kings to assemble, on the summit of a hill called [[Swaranûl]], he gives a speech declaring that the Men of the Great Ordeal shall eat Sranc from that point forward to sustain themselves.{{5|13}}

===''The Great Ordeal'' ===
Kellhus leads the Great Ordeal through [[Aörsi]] to [[Dagliash]]. He meets frequently alone with his Exalt-Generals. Kellhus flies a raft to move a company along with [[Swayal Compact|The Nuns]] into battle over the mountains of Dagliash, delivering Saubon and his riders directly to the massed Horde of Sranc. His sorceries is so powerful as to eat the mountain to reveal the legendary Well of [[Viri]] and crushing the Sranc and [[Bashrag]] waiting within the old Mansion.{{6|13}}

He warns his Lords and all the Schoolmen about the Consult and the Inchoroi:

{{Blockquote|"They will come. They will not abandon such might as the Horde manifests to our design. The Unholy Consult will intervene.  At long last, my brothers, you will vie with our foe in the flesh, grapple with the Cause that moves you."|Anasûrimbor Kellhus, The Great Ordeal, Chapter 13}}&lt;br /&gt;After the battle, Kellhus charges Proyas to lead the Ordeal north as Saubon is dead. Proyas realizes Kellhus is leaving. {{6|15}}

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
During the battle for Golgotterath in the closing moments of the ''[[The Unholy Consult|Unholy Consult]], ''Anasûrimbor Kellhus is destroyed and the Sranc legions obliterated his leaderless armies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
Kellhus fathered six children with his second wife Esmenet, four sons and two daughters:

* [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayûtas]], eldest of the Prince-Imperials and General of the [[Kidruhil]].
* [[Anasûrimbor Theliopa|Theliopa]], eldest daughter of Kellhus and Esmenet. She stays with her mother in Momemn as an advisor.
* [[Anasûrimbor Serwa|Serwa]], second daughter of Kellhus and Esmenet, and Grandmistress of the Swayal Sisterhood.
* [[Anasûrimbor Inrilatas|Inrilatas]], second son of Kellhus and Esmenet, insane and imprisoned on the Andiamine Heights.
* [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas|Kelmomas]], their youngest, the twin of Samarmas.
* [[Anasûrimbor Samarmas|Samarmas]], twin of Kelmomas. Samarmas seems not to have inherited any of his father's Dûnyain traits.

Additionally, Kellhus adopted the son of his first wife Serwë, [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II|Moënghus II]], who was raised as the fraternal twin of Kayûtas.{{4|3}}

Kellhus had bred a Dûnyain son, Anasûrimbor Koringhus, before leaving Ishuäl.

==Miracles during the First Holy War==
According to the ''Encyclopedic Glossary'', Kellhus performed three miracles during the Holy War's march on Shimeh, the Miracle of Water, referring to his discovery of water in the wastes of [[Khemema]],{{EG|Miracle of Water}} and the Miracle of the Circumfixion, referring to his survival of the Circumfix in Caraskand.{{EG|Miracle of the Circumfixion}} It's not clear what the third miracle is.

'''Eärwa''' (“[Land of the] Felled Sun” in Thoti-Eännorean), is the traditional name of all the lands to the west of the [[Great Kayarsus]] Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Eärwa’&lt;/ref&gt; It is counted as one of three continents or subcontinents&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, ''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt; of [[the World]], lying to the west of [[Eänna]] and north of [[Kutnarmu]]. It was the site of the [[Apocalypse|First Apocalypse]], the [[Holy War]] and the current [[Great Ordeal]].

Eärwa is divided into several regions:

* The [[Ancient North]]: once the heart of human civilization before its ruin in the First Apocalypse, now dominated by the [[Sranc]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ancient North’&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Three Seas]]: the current heart of human civilization, a cluster of nations and cities arrayed around three great bodies of water, divided between the faiths of [[Inrithism]] and [[Fanimry]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Three Seas’&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zeüm]]: an isolationist power in the far west of Eärwa, separated from the rest of the continent by the [[Atkondras Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Zeüm’&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kutnarmu]]: the region south of the Three Seas, consisting of little-known and little-explored desert regions. Kutnarmu may be a separate continent or subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kutnarmu’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Races==
Eärwa is home to three known intelligent species:

* '''Humans''', commonly called '''Men''', are the dominant species of the continent, numbering approximately 75 million souls, most of them clustered around the Three Seas. Although small roving bands of primitive humans have existed in Eärwa since the dawn of recorded time, they only arrived on the continent in force 4,132 years ago during the epic [[Breaking of the Gates]].
* '''[[Nonmen]]''', an ancient and immortal species. The original inhabitants of Eärwa, the entire female half of the species was murdered in the horrific event known as the [[Womb Plague]], which took place at least five millennia ago and potentially far more. The male half of the species endures, but with limited means of reproduction (they can reproduce with human females, but such offspring mostly die and very few survive) their numbers have dwindled and the survivors have grown increasingly [[Erratic|insane]] due to the passing of the millennia.
* '''[[Inchoroi]]''', an alien race which originated on another world. The Inchoroi were brought to the World by a great Ark-of-the-Skies, the [[Incû-Holoinas]], which [[Arkfall|crashed]] in the far north-west of Eärwa many thousands of years ago. They fought [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars|several wars]] against the Nonmen but were eventually defeated and almost completely wiped out. Only two Inchoroi remain living in Eärwa.

However, several of the weapon-races of the Inchoroi remain extant. The vile [[Bashrag|Bashrags]] and colossal, powerful [[Wracu]] are troubling, but do not survive in large numbers. Far more concerning are the [[Sranc]], hideous, hostile and bestial creatures which dominate the northern half of the continent.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">[[File:Zeum.png|thumb|400px|Zeum in 4109.]]
'''Zeüm''', or '''High Holy Zeüm''', is a large, mysterious and powerful [[Satyothi]] nation located in the far south and west of [[Eärwa]]. It is located to the west of the [[Atkondras Mountains]] and the [[Carathay Desert]], formidable geographical obstacles which prevent easy passage from Zeüm to the [[Three Seas]]. It is also separated from the [[Jiünati Steppe]] by the [[Jorua]] Sea. These geographic barriers have maintained Zeüm's relative isolation from the rest of the continent and prevented any major military conflicts from erupting. The only exception is the distant south, where a very narrow and precarious stretch of mountainous coast connects south-eastern Zeüm to the far north-west of [[Nilnamesh]]. The Nilnameshi fortress of [[Auvangshei]] was built here in ages past to defend against incursions from the west.

Zeüm's administrative capital is [[Domyot]], the Black Iron City. This city is the located of the [[Palace of Plumes]], from where the great [[Satakhan]], the hereditary ruler of the nation, rules. The present ruler of Zeüm is the Great Satakhan [[Nganka’kull ut Imbaroon]] (4087— ), whose heir or Successor-Prince is [[Zsoronga ut Nganka’kull]].

Zeümi silks and steel are considered the best in the [[Three Seas]]. Zeüm is also known for its [[Zeümi Sword-Dancers|Sword-Dancers]]: incredibly skilled warriors of an exotic cult who worship the sword.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Zeüm’&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Satyothi made their way to the far south and west of Eärwa shortly after the [[Breaking of the Gates]] and settled the shores of the [[Great Ocean]]. The [[Nonman]] Mansion of [[Incissal]] was located in this region and fell to the Satyothi, but it is unclear if this was through violence or some other means. The Satyothi inherited Incissal, turning it into a stronghold of their people, as well as building new cities such as Domyot. The region became known to the [[Norsirai]] of the [[Ancient North]] under the name “Angka.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Angka’&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 14th Century Zeüm had been unified under [[Mbotetulu]] (1340-1426), Satakhan of the Ojogi Dynasty. Remarkably, the nation appears to have survived intact from that day to this, an uninterrupted period of history lasting three thousand years. Key to the unification and unity of Zeüm was the [[Iswazi]], a form of sorcery revolving around totems (possibly an off-shoot of the [[Anagogis]]). [[Iswa]] (c. 1450-1530) pioneered this form of sorcery, which in time outstripped and supplanted the earlier [[Satta]] tradition. The [[Mbimayu]] school was founded and sponsored by the Satakhan, thus granting him access to sorcery and sorcerer-advisors in a similar fashion to the later [[Imperial Saik]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Iswa'&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it suffered the impact of the [[Years of the Crib]] along with the rest of the continent, Zeüm was left untouched by the [[Apocalypse]] and played no significant role in its unfolding.

During the [[Age of Cenei]], [[Triamis the Great]] considered an invasion of Zeüm and even led an army across the Nilnemeshi frontier, winning a significant victory at the [[Battle of Amarah]] in 2485, but his homesick troops relented and he returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossry, 'Ceneian Empire'&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Unification Wars]], [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] send emissaries to Domyot to suggest an alliance against the [[Consult]]. The result was the [[Blue Lotus Treaty]], with the Successor-Prince Zsoronga taken into the Aspect-Emperor's entourage as an honoured guest (and also a convenient hostage). Zsoronga marched with the [[Great Ordeal]]. However, the Satakhan was not wholly convinced by the threat of the Consult, so sent his representative [[Malowebi]] to treat with the [[Fanim]] under [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The White Luck Warrior]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1383">The '''Outside''' is that which lies beyond the World.

Most commentators follow [[Ajencis]]'s so-called Dyadic Theory when characterizing the World and its relation to the Outside. In ''[[Meta-Analytics]]'', Ajencis argues that it is the relation between subject and object, desire and reality, that underwrites the structure of existence. The World, he argues, is simply the point of maximal objectivity, the plane where the desires of individual souls are helpless before circumstance (because it is fixed by the desire of the [[God]] of Gods). The many regions of the Outside then represent diminishing levels of objectivity, where circumstances yield more and more to desire. This, he claims, is what defines the "spheres of dominance" of Gods and demons. As he writes, "the greater will commmands." The more powerful enitities of the outside dwell in "sub-realities" that conform to their desires. This is what makes piety and devotion so important: the more favour an individual can secure in the Outside (primarily through the worship of gods and the honouring of ancestors), the greater the chance of finding bliss in the afterlife&lt;ref&gt;Encylopedic Glossary, p. 476, 'Outside'&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Daimos|Daimotic]] [[sorcery]] can be used to summon [[Ciphrang]] from the Outside&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 435, 'Daimos'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ajencis is the father of syllogistic logic and algebra, held by many to be the greatest of all philosophers. Born in the [[Kyraneas|Kyranean]] capital of [[Mehtsonc]], he is reputed to have never once left his city, even during the horrific plagues of 1991, when his advanced age made his death a near certainty. (According to various sources, Ajencis bathed on a daily basis and refused to drink water drawn from city wells, claiming that these practices, combined with a distaste for drunkenness and a moderate diet, were the keys to his health.)

Many commentators, both antique and contemporary, complain that there are as many Ajencises as there are readers of Ajencis. Though this is certainly true of his more speculative works (such as ''[[Theophysics]]'' or ''[[The First Analytic of Men]]''), his work does possess a discernible and consistent sceptical core, primarily exemplified in ''[[The Third Analytic of Men]],'' which also happens to be his most cynical work. For Ajencis, [[Men]] by and large “make their weaknesses, not reason or the world, the primary measure of what they hold true.” In fact, he observed that most individuals possess no criteria whatsoever for their beliefs.

As a so-called critical philosopher, one might have supposed he would eventually share the fate of other critical philosophers, such as [[Porsa]] (the famed “Philosopher-Whore” of [[Trysë]]) or [[Kumhurat]]. Only his reputation and the structure of Kyranean society saved him from the vicissitudes of the mob. As a child, he was allegedly such a prodigy that the High King himself took notice of him, granting him what was called Protection at the unprecedented age of eight. Protection was an ancient and hallowed Kyranean institution; the “Protected” were those who could say anything without fear of reprisal, even to the High King. Ajencis continued speaking until he suffered a stroke and died at the venerable age of 103.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ajencis’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">'''Sranc''' are violent, inhuman creatures first [[Tekne|created]] by the [[Inchoroi]] as instruments of war against the [[Nonmen]]. Capable of language, they speak [[Languages|Aghurzoi]] (“Cut Tongue” in [[Ihrimsû]]).
[[File:Sranc_03_sm.jpg|thumb|300px]]
[[File:Sranc_02_sm.jpg|thumb|300px]]

==Origin==
According to the ''[[Isûphiryas]],'' the Sranc are one of the “Weapon Races” created by the Inchoroi to prosecute their war of extermination against the Nonmen and their [[Emwama]] slaves.

==Nature==
The motivations of the Sranc seem to be as base as imaginable, in that they seem to find sexual gratification in acts of violence. There are innumerable accounts of the indiscriminate rape of men, women, children, and even corpses. They seem to know nothing of mercy or honour, and though they do take prisoners, very few are known to have survived captivity, which is said to be savage beyond imagining.

==Physiology==
They reproduce rapidly. Though no outward physical differences are readily visible, female Sranc seem to have roles identical to those of male Sranc. Apparently, a great number of Sranc in various stages of pregnancy were observed in battle over the course of the [[Apocalypse]]. Though generally inferior to [[Men]] in individual combat, they are ideal logistically, as they are able to live for sustained periods on little more than grubs and insects. Survivors recount tales of vast tracts of ground overturned and rooted by passing Sranc hordes. Under the command of the [[No-God]] they are utterly fearless, and seem to strike with unerring control and coordination.

==Appearance==
Typically, Sranc stand no higher than the average [[caste]]-menial’s shoulder. Their skin is devoid of pigment, and despite the refined—to the point of repulsiveness—beauty of their faces, their physiognomy is bestial (though hairless), with pinched shoulders and deep, almond-shaped breasts. They are exceedingly fast across both open and broken terrain, and their sheer viciousness is said to compensate for their slight stature.

==Threat==
[[Mandate]] scholars are prone to make dire warnings about the present numbers of Sranc in [[Eärwa]]. Apparently the ancient [[Norsirai]] had reduced the Sranc, pressing them to the margins of Eärwa, and the No-God was still able to summon hosts that reportedly blackened the horizon. Now Sranc dominate half the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Sranc’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Species==
[[Ursranc]] are a subspecies of Sranc that have been bred for obedience.

==Other Names==
Sranc were first called '''Anyasiri''' (“Tongueless Howlers” in Ihrimsû) by the Nonmen.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Anyasiri’&lt;/ref&gt; They are colloquially known as “skinnies” by the [[Scalpoi|scalpers]] who hunt them for the Holy Bounty.

==Known Tribes==
* [[Kig’krinaki]]
* [[Xoägi’i]]

The '''Nonmen''' (in their own tongue, '''Cûnuroi''') are an immortal non-human species native to [[Eärwa]], whose presence preceded the arrival of [[Men]] by tens of thousands of years. They achieved a tremendous level of civilisation before the [[Arkfall]], the arrival of the [[Incû-Holoinas]] and the vile [[Inchoroi]] it carried within it. The Nonmen triumphed over the Inchoroi over the course of millennia of battle, but were so weakened by the conflict and resulting cataclysms that they were unable to prevent the arrival of men in Eärwa, who subsequently supplanted them. Today, Nonmen are only found in numbers in [[Ishterebinth]], their sole surviving stronghold. All Nonmen females were killed thousands of years ago in the [[Womb Plague]], leaving only males. The passage of millennia has driven many of the Nonmen insane; these madmen are known as the [[Erratic]].

==Mythology==
According to myth, [[Imimorûl]] was the first Nonman. He fled from the Heavens into the depths under the world in a way of avoiding the gaze of the gods. In the most common scripture, Imimorûl founded [[Siöl]] as the first of the High Mansions and beget at least two children, [[Tsonos]] and [[Olissis]]. After his death, Tsonos followed his father as High King of the Nonmen. However, [[Nihrimsul]] was founded by other Nonmen from outside this tradition and rejected Siöl's authority, leading to millennia of strife and occasional war. All of the other High Mansions were founded by Siöl and by descendants of Tsonos. The Nihrimsuli, sometimes called "Dark Nonmen", were disregarded for their lack of noble blood until [[Sin’niroiha]] of Nihrimsul married [[Tsinirû]] of [[Ishoriöl]]; their son [[Nil’giccas]] was accounted of the blood of Tsonos, thus reuniting the bloodlines.

According to the Nihrimsûli, their Mansion was actually founded by Imimorûl directly. Tsonos and Olissis murdered their father whilst he slept and then fled like cowards to found Siöl. Unsurprisingly, this version is thoroughly rejected in the dominant Tsonic tradition.

Imimorûl is named as the “Father of the False” in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', and in Mannish traditions, was a once-glorious God imprisoned deep in the earth as punishment for teaching sorcery to the Nonmen. According to Cûnuroi traditions, Imimorûl was not imprisoned within the earth, but sought refuge in the “Deepest Deep,” those places the gods could not judge because they could not see. Though Ajencis famously attributes the Nonman aversion to open sky to his theory of “vital accommodations,” the Nonmen themselves see this predilection as a sacred observance of Imimorûl’s ancient straits—as well as the best way to find oblivion upon their deaths.

Nonmen occasionally practice a ritual trip to the deepest part of the world they can find, known as a Fathoming. The Fathoming constitutes a symbolic re-enactment of Imimorûl’s flight from the Heavens (or “Starving”) into the depths beneath what became Siol, the House Primordial, the idea being that souls so deep can slip the notice of the Gods and find oblivion. Fathomings were most common undertaken by those upon the threshold of death, the thought being that the Deepest Deep lay on the edge of Oblivion.

The ''Psalms of Imimorûl'' seem to allege that Imimorûl had no wife but instead created the rest of the Nonman species by implanting his flesh within that of lions:

The World to him, who sings my song,&lt;br /&gt;
for I am the Font, the Spirit of the Deepest Deep,&lt;br /&gt;
and mine is the first heart to beat your blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who sings my song.&lt;br /&gt;
I, Imimorul, fled the Heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
so much did I love&lt;br /&gt;
the brooks that chirrup,&lt;br /&gt;
the high mountains that hiss,&lt;br /&gt;
the myriads that bolt through this blessed hair,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who raises up&lt;br /&gt;
rooves in the Deep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I, Imimorul, did flee the Starving [sky],&lt;br /&gt;
so much did I fear the Heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
the wrath of those who were wroth,&lt;br /&gt;
who would forbid my love,&lt;br /&gt;
of the myriads of the World.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to her, who kindles her fire in the Deep.&lt;br /&gt;
I, Imimorul, did cut from my hand my fingers,&lt;br /&gt;
and from my arm, my hand,&lt;br /&gt;
and from my body, my arm,&lt;br /&gt;
and these pieces of me I did place&lt;br /&gt;
in the wombs of Lions,&lt;br /&gt;
so that I might dwell content in my own company.&lt;br /&gt;
And I became One-Armed, Imimorul, the Unshielded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And you were as children to me, the form of Gods as the issue of Lions,&lt;br /&gt;
sons who would father nations, and&lt;br /&gt;
daughters who would mother the&lt;br /&gt;
myriads of the World.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I sang to you such songs&lt;br /&gt;
as are only heard in the highest of Heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
and nowhere in the Hells.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We did weep together, as we sang,&lt;br /&gt;
for woe cares not for names or glory&lt;br /&gt;
only that skin blackens for bruising,&lt;br /&gt;
breaks for blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who sings my song. The World to him, who finds me in the Deep. The World to him, and woe.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Imimorûl'&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Nonmen call themselves ''ji’cûnû roi,'' “the People of Dawn,” for reasons they can no longer remember. (They call [[Men]] ''j’ala roi,'' “the People of Summer,” because they burn so hot and pass so quickly.) ''The Chronicle of the Tusk,'' which records the coming of Men to Eärwa, generally refers to Nonmen as Oserukki, the “Not Us.” In the Book of Tribes, the Prophet [[Angeshraël]] alternately refers to them as “the Accursed Ones” and “the sodomite Kings of Eärwa,” and he incites the [[Five Tribes of Men|Four Nations of Men]] to embark on a holy war of extermination. Even after four millennia, this xenocidal mission remains part of the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] canon. According to the Tusk, the Nonmen are anathema:

:''Hearken, for this the God has said,''
:''“These False Men offend Me;''
:''blot out all mark of their Passing.”''

==Accomplishments==
But Cûnuroi civilization was ancient even before these words were carved into the Tusk. While the Halaroi, Men, wandered the world dressed in skins and wielding weapons of stone, the Cûnuroi had invented writing and mathematics, astrology and geometry, sorcery and philosophy. They dredged mountains hollow for the galleries of their High Mansions. They traded and warred with one another. They subdued all Eärwa, enslaving the [[Emwama]], the soft-hearted Men who dwelt in Eärwa in those early days.

==Decline==
[[File:Kings.jpg|thumb|right|300px|At the fields of Pir Pahal, Cû’jara-Cinmoi, greatest of the Nonman Kings, confronts the fierce Inchoroi King Sil, armored in festering bodies.]]
Their decline is the result of three different catastrophic events. The first, and most significant, was the so-called [[Womb Plague]]. In the hope of achieving immortality, the Nonmen (specifically, the great [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]) allowed the [[Inchoroi]] to live among them as their physicians. The Nonmen did in fact attain immortality, and the Inchoroi, claiming their work done, retired back to the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. The plague struck shortly after, almost killing males and uniformly killing all females. The Nonmen call this tragic event the Nasamorgas, the “Death of Birth.”

==Cûno-Inchoroi Wars and Near-Extinction==
[[File:Bashrag-v-Nonman sm.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A sorcerous Nonman battling a hideous Bashrag.]]
The following [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] further sapped their strength, so that by the time the first Tribes of Men invaded, the Nonmen had not the numbers or, some say, the will to resist their advance. Within the course of a few generations they were nearly exterminated. Only the Mansions of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]] and [[Cil-Aujas]] survived.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Nonmen’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interbreeding==
It is possible for Nonmen to impregnate human women; and, when Nonmen females still existed, it was possible for them to be impregnated by human men. However, such mixed-breed pregnancies are rare, and it is even rarer for them to come to term.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do survive may have very long lives; [[Anasûrimbor Nanor-Ukkerja I]]’s life of 178 years was credited to the Nonman blood in his veins.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kûniüri’&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known instance of interbreeding between humans and Nonmen was [[Cimoira]], the child of the human [[Sirwitta]] and a female Nonman, whose birth was recorded in the ''[[Isûphiryas]].''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mansions==
Instead of cities and castles Nonmen built underground systems of vast halls and passages called "[[Mansion|Mansions]]", always located beneath the mountains. The total number of Nonmen mansions is unknown, although it is known that the mightiest, the High Mansions, numbered nine.

Greatest, most powerful and most populous was '''Siöl''', lying under the titanic peaks of the [[Great Kayarsus|Northern Kayarsus]]. The proudest and most fiercely independent was '''Nihrimsul''', located under the south-eastern Yimaleti Mountains. '''Cil-Aujas''' lay in the east, under the peak of Aenaratiol at the south tip of the Osthwai Mountains. '''Ishoriöl''', the Exalted Hall, lay in the far west, beyond the [[Demua Mountains|Demua]] Mountains near the shores of the Great Ocean. '''Viri''', in the north, lay under the peak of Antareg in the Urokkas, a small range of mountains overlooking the [[Neleöst]], the Misty Sea. '''[[Illisserû]]''' lay far to the south, under the Betmulla Mountains. [[Curunq]] lay under the [[Araxes Mountains]] and [[Cil-Aumûl]] under the [[Hinayati Mountains]]. The last, [[Incissal]], lay under the hills near what is now the city of [[Domyot]].

==Physiology==
Nonmen are bigger and stronger than humans. They are adapted to subterranean life and thus have skin devoid of any pigment, all-black eyes, and are hairless.

It is mentioned in the books that Nonmen cannot derive meaning from paintings, which is why they depict their history through sculpture. This may imply that they do not see colors, having monochrome vision.

The god-alien 'Engineers' in the movie "Prometheus" (2012) by Ridley Scott look almost exactly like Bakker's Nonmen.

The '''No-God''' is an entity summoned by the [[Consult]] in the spring of the year 2143 to bring about the [[Apocalypse]], and again in 4132 during the [[Second Apocalypse]].

Very little is known about the No-God, save that he utterly lacks remorse or compassion and possesses terrible power, including the ability to control [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag]], and [[Wracu]] as extensions of his own will. Because of his armor, the so-called Carapace, which eyewitnesses describe as an iron (or [[nimil]]{{2|7}}) sarcophagus suspended in the heart of a mountainous whirlwind, it is not even known whether he is a creature of flesh or of spirit. According to [[Mandate]] scholars, the [[Inchoroi]] worship him as their savior, as do — according to some — the [[Scylvendi]].{{EG|No-God}}

Somehow, his mere existence is antithetical to human life: during the entirety of the Apocalypse, not one infant drew breath — all were stillborn. He is apparently immune to [[sorcery]] (according to legend, eleven [[Chorae]] are embedded in the Carapace). The [[Heron Spear]] is the only known weapon that can harm him.{{EG|No-God}}

The No-God was killed by [[Anaxophus V]] at the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]] in 2155.{{EG|Battle of Mengedda, the Second}} According to popular legend, his body turned to ash, which swept across the land and caused the [[Indigo Plague]]. Mandate scholars dispute this, claiming that the No-God’s body was recovered by the Consult and interred in [[Golgotterath]].{{EG|Indigo Plague}} Whatever the outcome, the No-God was summoned once more before Golgotterath in 4132.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
During the final moments of the battle for Golgotterath, the No-God was summoned. Once again, all across the world, humans could feel his presence. Babies were again stillborn. His resurrection caused the [[Great Ordeal]] to scatter in panic, therefore beginning the Second Apocalypse. The Hordes swarmed around him, and the remaining armies of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] were destroyed. &lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Names==
Known as Mog-Pharau (from which “No-God” is derived{{2|1}}) in ancient [[Kûniüri]]c. Known as Tsurumah (“Hated One”{{EG|Tsurumah}}) in ancient [[Kyranean]]. Known as Lokung (“Dead-God”{{EG|Lokung}}) to the [[Scylvendi]]. Known as Mursiris (“Wicked North”{{EG|Mursiris}}) to the [[Shiradi Empire|Shiradi]]. Known as Cara-Sincurimoi (“Angel of Endless Hunger”{{EG|Cara-Sincurimoi}}) by the [[Nonmen]]. Known as Great Ruiner to the surviving tribes of [[Men]] in the [[Ancient North]].{{EG|Great Ruiner}} Known as World-Breaker.{{EG|World-Breaker}}

== Nature ==
No-God is invisible from the outside, therefore the Gods cannot see him and help their believers against him.

Author explained in Q/A: ''A better way to think of the No-God is as a philosophical zombie (p-zombie), of a piece with all the other soulless instruments of the Inchoroi. A perfectly unconscious god, and so in that respect, entirely at one with material reality, continuous with it, and so an agency invisible to the Outside.''

A powerful artifact of the [[Inchoroi]] [[Tekne]], so named because of its unique shape. The Heron Spear first appears in the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'' as Suörgil (“Shining Death” in Ihrimsû), the great “[[spears of light|spear of light]].”

It was taken by [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] from the corpse of [[Sil]], the Inchoroi King, at the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]]. For millennia the Heron Spear lay in the possession of the [[Nonmen]] of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]], until it was stolen by [[Cet’ingira]] and delivered to [[Golgotterath]] c. 750. Then in 2140 it was stolen again by [[Seswatha]], who believed it to be the only weapon capable of destroying the [[No-God]]. For a brief time it was thought destroyed at the catastrophic [[Battle of Eleneöt Fields]], but it reappeared in 2154 in the possession of [[Anaxophus V]], High King of [[Kyraneas]], who used it to slay the No-God at the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]]. For centuries it resided in [[Cenei]], a treasured possession of the [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]]s, only to be lost once again when the [[Scylvendi]] sacked Cenei in 3351.

The Heron Spear’s whereabouts are presently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Heron Spear’&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chorae by spiralhorizon-d6ps51q.png|thumb|300px]]

==Appearance==
In appearance, Chorae are small iron spheres, one inch in diameter, that are banded by runes written in Gilcûnya, the holy tongue of the [[Nonmen]] [[Qûya]].

==Function==
Chorae are extraordinary in that they render their bearer immune to all sorcerous Cants and instantly kill any [[sorcerer]] who comes into contact with them.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Chorae’&lt;/ref&gt; Sorcerers who touch Chorae are turned to salt. It is said that some Nonmen have [[Mark]]s so strong that simply being near a Chorae is enough to destroy them. [[Ciphrang]], more commonly known as demons, are also turned to salt by the touch of a Chorae.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Although the principles behind their creation (they belong to lost branch of [[sorcery]] called the [[Aporos]]) are no longer understood, thousands are believed to circulate in the [[Three Seas]] alone. The Chorae play a pivotal role in the political balance of power in the Three Seas, insofar as they allow the non-scholastic Great Factions to check the power of the Schools.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Chorae’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chorae bowmen''' are specialized units that use Chorae affixed to the end of arrow shafts or crossbow bolts to kill enemy sorcerers. Chorae archers are a staple of almost every military organization in [[Eärwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Chorae bowmen’&lt;/ref&gt; The sorcerers uses pejorative for Chorae archers—“Weepers”—those who “shed” the Tears of [[God of Gods|God]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
When the Inchoroi began using Men to master the [[Aporos]] and produce the first Chorae, they gave the first sorcery-destroying spheres to the [[Sranc]], only to discover that the creatures were far too reckless. Having fixed and morbid habits of ornamentation, the Sranc rarely valued the spheres, and were thus prone to lose them.

So the Inchoroi began giving them to the Men of Eärwa, hoping to incite them to rebellion. But the Halaroi had no stomach for rousing a feared, and most importantly, absent master, and so rendered the deadly gifts to their Nonmen overlords. The Inchoroi then looked to Eänna, where the Men were both more fierce and more naive. They gave the Chorae to the Five Tribes as gifts, and to one tribe, the black-haired Ketyai, they gave a great tusk inscribed with their hallowed laws and most revered stories–as well as one devious addition: the divine imperative to invade the ‘Land of the Felled Sun’ and hunt down and exterminate the ‘False Men.’

== Number available ==
Author himself explains: ''as for the numbers of Chorae, no one is quite sure how many are extant. Because the Few can sense them, most scholars assume that the present day numbers haven't dwindled too much since the Cuno-Inchoroi Wars - it's primarily a question of distribution. There's some ten thousand or so estimated to be in the Three Seas. Then there's the famed 'Chorae Hoard' of Sakarpus, and the far greater hoard amassed by the Consult in Golgotterath.''

[[File:Inchoroi2.jpg|thumb|300px|Another concept sketch of an Inchoroi, before and after the head graft.]]The '''Inchoroi''' are a mysterious and obscene race that, according to legend, descended from the void in the [[Incû-Holoinas]].{{EG|Inchoroi}}

==Origins==
The Inchoroi are a genetically-engineered weapon race. They were created by a species known only as the [[progenitors]], apparently on another world many thousands and possibly tens of thousands of years ago. The progenitors achieved total technological and biological mastery but then discovered inarguable evidence (possibly through the creation of the [[Inverse Fire]]) that they were doomed to eternal damnation. The Inchoroi and the [[Incû-Holoinas]] were created to save them from this fate, presumably by reducing the number of living beings on other planets until the threat of damnation was lifted.

The fate of the progenitors is unknown. The Inchoroi themselves remember nothing of their origins; what scant information is known was extracted by [[Cet’ingira]] and the [[Dûnyain]] from the Ark over the course of many years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
Very little is known about them, aside from their apparently limitless capacity for cruelty and their malignant obsession with the carnal.{{EG|Inchoroi}} They worship the [[No-God]] as their saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘No-God’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goal of the Inchoroi is to prevent the eventual eternal damnation of their souls by severing the connection between the World and the [[Outside]]. They believe this can be accomplished by reducing the number of souls in the world below 144,000. They attempted this on many other worlds, prevailing each time only to find themselves still damned, before the Incû-Holoinas crashed into [[Eärwa]], which they view as the land of their redemption.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creations==
Inchoroi [[Tekne]] is responsible for the creation of a number of races, including [[Bashrag]]s, [[Sranc]], [[Skin-spies]], [[Synthese]], and [[Wracu]]. The [[Heron Spear]] is also an artifact of Inchoroi Tekne.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Heron Spear’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Names==
The name ''Inchoroi'' means “People of Emptiness” in Ihrimsû, and was given to them by [[Ingalira]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt; The Inchoroi refer to themselves as a “race of lovers.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wracu''' (also known as '''Dragons''') are immense, fire-spitting winged reptilian monstrosities created by the [[Inchoroi]] during the ancient [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] to destroy the [[Nonmen]] [[Qûya]], then subsequently wielded by the [[No-God]] during the [[Apocalypse]].

[[Wutteät]] is the Father of Dragons and claims to have ridden in the [[Incû-Holoinas|Ark]] with the Inchoroi before they crashed on [[Eärwa]].

According to [[Drusas Achamian]], Wracu are lazy and selfish creatures when not being driven by the No-God’s will. Immortal, they see little benefit in attacking [[Men]], as humans will simply replenish their numbers through breeding.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ark sm.jpg|thumb|300px|The Ark of the Inchoroi topples from the void …]]
The '''Incû-Holoinas''' (“Ark-of-the-Skies” in [[Languages|Ihrimsû]]) is the great space-faring vessel that brought the [[Inchoroi]] from the void and became the golden heart of [[Golgotterath]]. The Ark's most famed feature are the two massive Golden Horns - or the "Oars of the Ark" - that protrude above the ground. It is assumed that the Horns were located at the rear of the vessel when it was in flight.{{EG|Incû-Holoinas}} The Ark's crash-landing, in the event known as [[Arkfall]] was violent enough to damage one of the two horns, leaving one upright and the other slightly canted.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|A cavernous void opened before them. It reminded Seswatha of a ship’s ribbed hold, though pitched on its end, and far too vast to truly resemble any work of Men. Sheer golden faces reared into obscurity, hazed by the smoke of countless fires. Structures of mortise and hacked stone climbed their foundations, crusting their sides like stacked hornets’ nests, not dwellings but open cells, squalid and innumerable.|The Ark’s interior as witnessed by [[Seswatha]]{{3|14}}}}

Some speculate that the Ark itself once lived; the Inchoroi call themselves “Children of the Ark” and the most ancient [[Nonmen]] songs refer to them as “the Orphans.”{{3|12}}

==Size==
The size of the Ark is heavily disputed by scholars, even in [[Far Antiquity]], with accounts varying tremendously.

According to one source, the Ark in totality is three thousand cubits in length, five hundred in width, and three hundred in depth.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Thousandfold Thought]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, ancient [[Nonman]] records and the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'' place the size of the Upright Horn alone at over ten thousand Nonman cubits in length. [[Sohonc]] measurements, rooted in mathematics and the measurement of the Horn's shadow, give an allegedly far more accurate reading of 9,724 Umeritic cubits in length.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Incû-Holoinas'&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the Upright Horn alone may exceed 13,700 feet (or 2.6 miles) in height. The Nonman measurements would be double this.

'''Tekne''' (also known as the Old Science) is the non-[[sorcery|sorcerous]] craft of the [[Inchoroi]], used to mould abominations out of living flesh. According to various [[Nonmen|Nonman]] sources, the Tekne proceeds on the presumption that everything in nature, including life, is fundamentally mechanical. Despite the absurdity of this claim, few dispute the efficacy of the Tekne, as the Inchoroi and the [[Consult]] after them have time and again demonstrated the ability to “manufacture flesh.” [[Mandate]] scholars claim that the fundamental principles of the Tekne have been long lost, and that the Consult can only proceed in a trial-and-error fashion, on the basis of an incomplete understanding, and using ancient and ill-understood instruments. This ignorance, they claim, is all that preserves the world from the [[No-God]]’s return.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Tekne’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4357">The '''Dûnyain''' are a severe monastic sect that has repudiated history and animal appetite in the name of finding enlightenment through the control of all desire and all circumstance. Their name means "Truth"&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 14, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Origins==

Though the origins of the Dûnyain are obscure (many think them the descendants of the ecstatic sects that arose across the [[Ancient North]] in the days preceding the [[Apocalypse]]), their belief system is utterly unique, leading some to conclude their original inspiration had to be philosophical rather than religious in any traditional sense.

==Philosophy==

Much of Dûnyain belief follows from their interpretation of what they consider their founding principles. The Emperical Priority Principle (sometimes referred to as the Principle of Before and After) asserts that within the circle of the world, what comes before determines what comes after without exception. The Rational Priority Principle asserts that Logos, or Reason, lies outside the circle of the world (though only in a formal and not an ontological sense). The Epistemological Principle asserts that knowing what comes before (via the Logos) yields "control" of what comes after.

Given the Priority Principle, it follows that thought, which falls within the circuit of the before and after, is also determined by what comes before. The Dûnyain therefore believe the will to be illusory, an artifact of the soul's inability to perceive what comes before it. The soul, in the Dûnyain world view, is ''part of the world'', and therefore as much driven by prior events as anything else. (This stands in stark contrast to the dominant stream of [[Three Seas]] and Ancient North thought, where the soul is taken to be, in [[Ajencis]]'s words, "that which precedes everything.")

In other words, [[Men]] do not possess "self-moving souls". Far from a given, such a soul is an ''accomplishment'' for the Dûnyain. All souls, they claim, possess ''conatus'', the natural striving to be self-moving, to escape the circle of before and after. They naturally seek to ''know'' the world about them and so climb out of the circle. But a host of factors make outright escape impossible. The soul men are born with is too obtuse and clouded by animal passions to be anything other than a slave of what comes before. The whole point of the Dûnyain ethos is to overcome these limitations and so become a self-moving soul -- to attain what they call the Absolute, or the Unconditioned Soul.

But unlike those exotic [[Nilnamesh]]i sects devoted to various other forms of "enlightenment", the Dûnyain are not so naive as to think this can be attained within the course of a single lifetime. They think of this, rather, as a multi-generational process. Quite early on they recognized that the instrument itself, the soul, was flawed, so they instituted a program of selective breeding for intellect and dispassion. In a sense the entire sect became a kind of experiment, isolated from the world to maintain control, with each prior generation training the next to the limit of their capabilities, the idea being that over the millennia they would produce souls that could climb further and further from the circle of before and after. The hope was that eventually they would produce a soul utterly transparent to Logos, a soul capable of apprehending all the darknesses that come before&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p.438, 'Dûnyain'&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biology==

After two thousand years of isolation and selective breeding, Dûnyain genetics have changed to the point where they have difficulty interbreeding with normal humans. The offspring of such couplings have a high risk of birth defects&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 3, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;. The ones that survive tend to have intellects superior to normal humans but inferior to pure Dûnyain.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The '''Mandate''' is a [[Gnostic]] [[The Schools|School]] founded by [[Seswatha]] in 2156 to continue the war against the [[Consult]] and to protect the Three Seas from the return of the [[No-God]].

Based in [[Atyersus]], the Mandate maintains missions in several different cities about the Three Seas and embassies in the courts of all the Great Factions. Aside from its apocalyptic calling, the Mandate is distinct from the other [[sorcery|sorcerous]] Schools in several respects, not the least of which is its possession of the Gnosis, a monopoly it has been able to protect for almost two thousand years. The Mandate also differs in the fanaticism of its members: apparently, all sorcerers of rank continuously dream Seswartha's experiences of the [[Apocalypse]] every night, the effect of a sorcerous rite called the Grasping, where initiates reputedly submit to incantations while holding Seswatha's mummified heart. Also, the members of the Mandate elect an executive council (called the Quorom) rather than an individual Grandmaster to further guard against deviations from their core mission.

Typically, the Mandate can boast between fifty and sixty sorcerers of rank, and perhaps twice that number of initiates. These numbers, which are typical of minor [[Anagogic]] Schools, are deceptive, however, since the power of the Gnosis makes the Mandate more than a match for schools as large as, say, the [[Scarlet Spires]]. Because of this power, the School has long been courted by the Kings of [[Conriya]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 463, 'Mandate, School of'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mandate sorcerers will never reveal the secrets of the Gnosis, even under torture, because the spirit of Seswatha prevents them&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 6, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">The '''Mangaecca''' was the ancient rival to the [[The Schools|School]] of [[Sohonc]], and last of the four original [[Gnosis|Gnostic]] Schools.

From its founding in 684 by [[Sos-Praniura]], the greatest student of [[Gin’yursis]], the School of Mangaecca had pursued a predatory ethos, regarding knowledge as the embodiment of power. Though this earned the School an ambiguous and seedy reputation, the Mangaecca managed to avoid running afoul of the High Gnostic Writ, the edict of King [[Nincama-Telesser]] circumscribing [[sorcery|sorcerous]] conduct.

Then, in 777, they were contacted by a demented [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Erratic]] named [[Cet’ingira]]. At his behest, they discovered the [[Incû-Holoinas]], the dread Ark of the [[Inchoroi]]. Over the following centuries, the Mangaecca Grandmasters continued their excavations of the Ark and their investigations of the [[Tekne]]. However, their repeated attempts to break into the Ark were met with failure. In 1123, rumours began spreading that [[Shaeönanra]], then Grandmaster of the Mangaecca, had finally entered the Ark and discovered a catastrophic means to undo the scriptural damnation of [[sorcerer]]s. The School was promptly outlawed, and the remainder of the School fled to [[Golgotterath]], abandoning [[Sauglish]] forever.

By the time of the [[Apocalypse]], they had transformed into what would be called the [[Consult]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Mangaecca’&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Eleneöt Fields''' was the greatest battle between the Horde of the [[No-God]] and the [[Second Ordeal]] of mankind on the [[Fields of Eleneöt]] in 2146.

The coming of the No-God was an unimaginable event. All living [[Men]] could sense his dread presence on the horizon, and all infants were born dead. This dark time became known as the [[Years of the Crib]]. [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], the High-King of [[Kûniüri]], had little difficulty gathering support for his Second Ordeal against this threat to all mankind. [[Nil’giccas]] and Celmomas were reconciled. Across [[Eärwa]], large hosts of Men began marching towards Kûniüri.

Despite having assembled the greatest host of their age, Celmomas and his allies were unprepared for the vast numbers of [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag]]s, and [[Wracu]] gathered by the No-God and his [[Consult]]. Celmomas was killed, almost all of his host annihilated, and Kûniüri fell to the enemy. The battle was a devastating catastrophe, and signalled the eventual destruction of the [[Norsirai]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Battle of Eleneöt Fields’&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Second Battle of Mengedda''' is the desperate battle where [[Anaxophus V]] and his southern tributaries and allies made their victorious stand against the Horde of the [[No-God]] at [[Mengedda]] in 2155.

The battle concluded when Anaxophus V destroyed the No-God with the [[Heron Spear]], ending the [[Apocalypse]]. As a result, it is thought by many to be the most important battle in history.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Gallery, 'Battle of Mengedda, the Second'&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the many battles that have occurred there, the site is also commonly known as the Battleplain&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 420, 'Battleplain'&lt;/ref&gt;.

As the site of innumerable battles, the fields are widely reputed to be haunted&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 466, 'Mengedda Plains'&lt;/ref&gt;. Bones and small objects are constantly vomited forth from the earth, and those who sleep there are prone to suffering nightmares. According to [[Drusas Achamian]], the death of the [[No-God]] turned the battleplain into a powerful [[topos]]. Common legend holds that the souls of all who die on the Battleplain remained trapped there, as exemplified by the line in ''[[The Sagas]]'', "The soul that encounters Him passes no further"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 490, "[The] soul that encounters Him passes no further"&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Cil-Aujas''' was one of the High Mansions of the [[Nonmen]], located beneath the mountain [[Aenaratiol]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; It was conquered by [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] after the fall of the [[Incû-Holoinas]] but before the first battles of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]. After the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], emboldened by [[Siöl]]’s distraction, [[Nihrimsul]] and Cil-Aujas had revolted. But after years of hard campaigning, Cû’jara-Cinmoi finally brought the [[Ishroi]] of Cil-Aujas to heel.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Gin’yursis]] of Cil-Aujas allied with [[Men]] during the [[Apocalypse]], and he and the [[Meöri Empire|Meöri]] hero [[Nostol]] held back the Horde of the [[No-God]] at the [[Battle of Kathol Pass]] in the autumn of 2151. However, due to their envy and hate of the Nonmen, Nostol and his warriors betrayed and killed Gin’yursis and his kin the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passage of two thousand years, Cil-Aujas became known as the Black Halls. It was suspected that [[Sranc]] used its corridors to travel under the mountains during winter; though many mercenaries went to the hall seeking to hunt Sranc for the bounty on their pelts, none returned, and rumours began spreading that a [[Wracu]] had taken residence within it. [[Drusas Achamian]] and the [[Skin Eaters]] discovered that there was not actually any Wracu; but that in addition to hordes of Sranc and [[Bashrag]]s, the ancient depradations of the Nonmen had turned the Mansion into a [[topoi|topos]].

The old Nonman Mansion of [[Cil-Aujas]] lies beneath the mountain.

'''Wathi Doll''' is a [[sorcery|sorcerous]] artifact common to [[Sansor]]i [[witch]]es, also known as a “murder doll,” either because a human sacrifice is required for its manufacture (a soul is imprisoned as the artifact’s animus) or because the Dolls are often used as remote assassins.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Wathi Doll’&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drusas Achamian]] possessed a Wathi Doll. He first used it to test whether [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] was one of the [[The Few|Few]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; then later to escape imprisonment by the [[Scarlet Spires]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

They are primarily charged with defending the Ark, and are also used by the [[Nonmen]] [[Erratic|Erratics]] who command Yoke Legions, since the Nonmen are too few in number relative to the Sranc to drive them alone.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The Encyclopaedic Glossary II&lt;/ref&gt;

They stand more erect (making them appear taller) and are broader through the shoulder - enough to resemble stunted Nonmen as much as Sranc.  They are generally armoured in a uniform manner (with black-iron scale hauberks and conical, sometimes brimmed, helms).  They are also commonly branded with the wedges symbolizing the Twin Horns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Skiin.png|thumb|300px]]
==Origin==
'''Skin-spies''' are creations of the [[Consult]], produced using [[Inchoroi]] [[Tekne]]. They call themselves the “Last Children of the Inchoroi” and the “Keepers of the [[Inverse Fire]],” though they themselves do not appear to know what this means.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
Skin-spies have bones composed of cartilage, which they can reshape at will; this allows them to take on the body shape of their target. Their heads are surrounded by dextrous webbed fingers which they use to simulate the nuances of facial expression. Physically, they are both faster and stronger than ordinary humans.

==Psychology==
Like [[Sranc]], skin-spies are base beings driven by the basic instincts of fear and lust. They gain pleasure only from inflicting fear and violence; however, they can control these urges well enough to impersonate those they kill and replace. Special methods are required to torture skin-spies, as they are aroused by pain. Skin-spies are limited in their capacity for deep thought; for instance, they are unable to comprehend paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirituality==
Skin-spies do not have souls. This renders them immune to [[sorcery]] which affects the soul, such as the [[Cants of Compulsion]]. They are also mostly incapable of performing sorcery themselves; the skin-spy which impersonated [[Polchias Simas]] is the only known exception.

==Behaviour==
When seeking to kill and replace a target, skin-spies will typically first take the form of a menial or slave who is close to them. Those of high-rank typically do not pay close enough attention to their servants to notice the substitution, while the skin-spy will have time to observe their true target’s mannerisms, and character.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Skin-spies are able to track people by scent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, they find the scent of pregnant women to be sickening, and will not attack them; apparently due to the need to comply with a prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known Skin-spies==
* [[Gaörta]]
* [[Maëngi]]
* [[Maörta]]
* [[Tsuör]]
* [[Ûssirta]]

* [[Ikurei Istriya]]
* [[Koll]]

* [[Biaxi Sompas]] &lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Esmenet]] &lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mimara]] &lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wutteät''' is a [[wracu]], ancient beyond measure. He claims to have lived aboard the [[Incû-Holoinas]] as it visited many worlds before crashing in [[Eärwa]]; and to have been the first being to depart the Ark, bearing [[Sil]] the [[Inchoroi]] King upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Wutteät's neck was reportedly broken by the [[Nonman]] warrior [[Ciögli]] during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt; However, he apparently survived and recovered, as the [[Mandate]] records him as being involved in the later [[Apocalypse]].

After the Apocalypse, Wutteät came to reside in the ruins of the [[Library of Sauglish]]. He grew old, blind, and decrepit over the subsequent two thousand years; he would occasionally fly out in search of cities to destroy, but was unable to find any. In 4132, his den was discovered by [[Drusas Achamian]] and [[Nil’giccas]]. The two fought the Wracu and eventually forced him to flee, though they were unable to kill him.

[[File:Skiotha.png|thumb|300px|Cnaiür by Quinthane]]

'''Cnaiür urs Skiötha''' is a Chieftain of the [[Utemot]], a tribe of [[Scylvendi]], who are feared across the [[Three Seas]] for their skill and ferocity in war. Because of the events surrounding the death of his father, [[Skiötha urs Hannut]], some thirty years previously, Cnaiür is despised by his own people, though none dare challenge him because of his savage strength and his cunning in war.

==Appearance==
Cnaiür is tall and powerfully built, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist. He has long black hair and intensely blue eyes. His forearms are covered in over two hundred [[swazond]], more than any other warrior.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==

==Skills==
Cnaiür is an exceptionally accomplished Scylvendi warrior. He is over 45 years old. He owns eight wives, twenty-three slaves, and more than three hundred cattle. He has fathered thirty-seven sons, nineteen pure-blooded.

==Story==
===What Came Before===
Thirty years prior to the events of ''[[The Darkness That Comes Before]],'' when Cnaiür was little more than a stripling, a man called [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]] had been captured, and given to Cnaiür’s father, Skiötha urs Hannut, as a slave. He claimed to be [[Dûnyain]], a people possessed of an extraordinary wisdom, and Cnaiür spent many hours with him, speaking of things forbidden to Scylvendi warriors.

At one point Moënghus, the slave, challenges Skiötha and with Cnaiür as his ally they force Skiötha’s hand. In the end, Moënghus is free and Skiötha is dead.

Cnaiür has been tormented by this ever since. Though he once loved the man, he now hates him with a deranged intensity. If only he could kill Moënghus, he believes, his heart could be made whole.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Word arrives that [[Ikurei Conphas]] has invaded the [[Jiünati Steppe]], and Cnaiür rides with the Utemot to join the Scylvendi horde on the distant Imperial frontier. Cnaiür senses a trap, but his warnings go unheeded by [[Xunnurit]]. The horde is destroyed but Cnaiür escapes and returns to the pastures of the Utemot more anguished than ever.

He rides to the graves of his ancestors, where he finds the grievously wounded [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] surrounded by circles of dead Sranc. Realizing the stranger could help him find Anasûrimbor Moënghus, Cnaiür takes him captive and later agrees to accompany him on his quest. The two strike out across the Steppe.

Near the Imperial frontier they encounter a party of hostile Scylvendi raiders. A battle ensues and in its aftermath they find a captive concubine called [[Serwë]]. Cnaiür takes her as his prize. Through her he realizes that the only possible way they can reach [[Shimeh]] is to join the [[Holy War]], which according to Serwë, gathers about the city of [[Momemn]] in the heart of the [[Nansur Empire]]—the one place he cannot go.

Cnaiür is convinced Kellhus will kill him. He confronts Kellhus, who claims he has use of him still. The two men battle on the mountainous heights but Kellhus easily overpowers him. To prove his intent to keep their bargain, he spares Cnaiür’s life.

After a desperate journey and pursuit through the heart of the Empire, they at last find their way to Momemn and the Holy War, where they are taken before the [[Conriya]]n Prince [[Nersei Proyas]]. Cnaiür claims to be the last of the Utemot, travelling with Anasûrimbor Kellhus, a Prince of the northern city of [[Atrithau]], who has dreamt of the Holy War from afar. Proyas, however, is far more interested in Cnaiür’s knowledge of the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] and their way of battle.

Proyas takes Cnaiür and Kellhus to a meeting of the Holy War’s leaders and the Emperor, where the fate of the Holy War is to be decided. The Emperor offers his brilliant nephew, Ikurei Conphas, flush from his spectacular victory over the Scylvendi at [[River Kiyuth|Kiyuth]], but only if the leaders of the Holy War pledge to surrender their future conquests. Proyas offers Cnaiür in Conphas’s stead. A vicious war of words ensues as Cnaiür spars with the Imperial nephew, but neither side gains an advantage. Kellhus finally manages to sway the crowd to side with Cnaiur. The Shriah’s representative orders the Emperor to provision the Men of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]]. The Holy War will march.

In a mere matter of days, Cnaiür has gone from a fugitive to a leader of the greatest host ever assembled in the Three Seas.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
As the Holy War marches deeper into Fanim territory, Cnaiür tries to teach Prince Proyas the rudiments of war as practised by the [[Kian]]ene. Assigned by Proyas to command a cohort of Conriyan outriders, he returns to the camp he shares with Anasûrimbor Kellhus, [[Drusas Achamian]], and the others. He knows that Kellhus now possesses Serwë’s body and soul and decides he can tolerate no more. He refuses to share Kellhus’s fire, and demands that Serwë come with him. Kellhus denies him and Cnaiür relinquishes her, though she continues to tyrannize his thoughts. His madness burns brighter. Some nights he roams the countryside, raping and murdering indiscriminately.

After the Holy War seizes the north bank of the [[River Sempis]], the Lords of the Holy War assign Cnaiür the task of planning the assault on southern [[Shigek]] and acclaim him their general for the impending battle. Kellhus comes to him, offering Serwë in exchange for the secrets of battle. Though cinflicted, Cnaiür agrees. He teaches Kellhus the principles of war.

Something breaks within Cnaiür. He leaves Kellhus and the others, abandons his command to collect his prize. But when he finds Serwë, another Kellhus is beating her, demanding information, a [[Skin-spies|skin-spy]]. He stabs him in the shoulder. The man flees, but not before Cnaiür glimpses his face crack open … Cnaiür seizes Serwë, begins dragging her to his camp. She rages at him, tells him that he beats her because she lies with Kellhus the way he had lain with Kellhus’s father. She tries to cut her own throat. Bewildered and undone, Cnaiür wanders aimlessly through the camp.

Later that night Kellhus finds him at the edge of the [[Meneanor]]. Thinking he is Moënghus, Cnaiür begs him to end his misery. The Dûnyain refuses.

Thinking the Holy War doomed, Cnaiür decides to take what compensation he can. He names Kellhus a “prince of nothing.” Only when Serwë is murdered by [[Cutias Sarcellus]] does he realize the consequences of his betrayal. Cnaiür flees, and in a moment of resurgent madness cuts a swazond across his own throat.

When Achamian confronts the Lords of the Holy War with the severed head of a [[Consult]] skin-spy, he finally grasps their meaning. He follows Sarcellus, who hastens from the assembly to the [[Csokis|temple-complex]] where his brothers [[Shrial Knights]] guards Kellhus upon the Circumfix. Knowing he intends to kill the Dûnyain, Cnaiür intercepts him, and they duel before the starving masses gathered about the dying Warrior-Prophet. But the skin-spy is too fast, too skilled. Cnaiür is saved only when [[Incheiri Gotian]] demands to know how Sarcellus learned to fight so. Exhausted, bloodied, Cnaiür beheads the counterfeit Shrial Knight. Raising its severed head to the sky, he shows the Holy War the true face of the Warrior-Prophet’s adversary. The hunt for Moënghus need not end.

The goal of the Consult is to reduce the number of souls in [[Eärwa]] below 144,000, which they believe will sever the connection between the World and the [[Outside]] and prevent the promised eternal damnation of their souls.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The White-Luck Warrior]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the term Consult is that it is a union or alliance between three distinct races: humanity, represented by [[Shaeönanra]]; the [[Inchoroi]], represented by [[Aurang]]; and the Nonmen, represented by [[Cet’ingira]]. Effectively these three individuals are the leaders of the Consult, although the representation of their races in the group radically differs. Men, originally of the [[Gnostic]] [[School]] of [[Mangaecca]], by far make up the majority. The Inchoroi contingent consists of just two, Aurang and his brother [[Aurax]]. This compact was forged after Cet'ingira breached the [[Barricades]] and accessed the [[Incû-Holoinas]], with Shaeönanra's assistance, in 1111.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Consult'&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in the next seven or eight years they found the last Inchoroi and made their alliance. Their first act in this alliance was to kill [[Titirga]], the head of the [[Sohonc]] and the greatest threat to them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, possibly longer, the Nonman [[Mansion]] of [[Ishterebinth]] has also aligned with the Consult, although not all of the inhabitants of the Mansion agreed with this course of action. [[Oirûnas]], Lord of the Watch, killed those [[Ishroi]] most in favour of this alliance, leaving its future status unclear.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Ordeal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sranc]], [[Bashrag|Bashrags]], [[Wracu]] and [[skin-spies]] are tools and servants of the Consult, but are not actual members of it themselves.

'''Cûno-Inchoroi Wars''' are the protracted series of wars between the [[Nonmen]] and the [[Inchoroi]] following the ancient arrival of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fall of the Incû-Holoinas==
According to the ''[[Isûphiryas]],'' the [[Incû-Holoinas]], the “Ark-of-the-Skies,” plunged to earth to the west of the [[Neleöst|Sea of Neleöst]] in land ruled by [[Nin’janjin]], the Nonman King of [[Viri]]. The letter sent by Nin’janin to [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], the King of [[Siöl]], is recorded as follows:

:''The Sky has cracked into potter’s shards,''
:''Fire sweeps the compass of Heaven,''
:''The beasts flee, their hearts maddened,''
:''The trees fall, their backs broken.''
:''Ash has shrouded all sun, choked all seed,''
:''The Halaroi howl piteously at the Gates,''
:''Dread Famine stalks my Mansion.''
:''Brother Siöl, Viri begs your pardon.''

Rather than send aid to Nin’janjin, Cû’jara-Cinmoi assembled an army and invaded the lands of Viri. Nin’janjin and his [[Ishroi]] capitulated without battle; Viri became a bloodless tributary of Siöl. The western lands of Viri, however, remained shrouded in cloud and ash. Survivors from the region spoke of a fiery vessel streaking across the skies. So Cû’jara-Cinmoi commanded [[Ingalira]], a hero of Siöl, to lead an expedition to find this Ark. What happened to Ingalira on this expedition is not recorded, but he returned to Siöl some three months later and presented two inhuman captives to Cû’jara-Cinmoi. Ingalira called these captives ''Inchoroi,'' or “People of Emptiness,” both because the sounds they made were empty of meaning and because they fell from the emptiness of the sky. He spoke of flattened forests and gouged plains, of mountains thrown into a ring, and of two golden horns rearing from a molten sea, so mighty they brushed the clouds.

Repelled by the obscene aspect of the Inchoroi, Cû’jara-Cinmoi had them put to death, and set a Watch upon the Incû-Holoinas, the Ark-of-the-Skies. Years passed, and the power of Cû’jara-Cinmoi and the High Mansion of Siöl waxed. The Mansion of [[Nihrimsul]] was subdued, and her King, [[Sin’niroiha]], “First Among Peoples,” was forced to wash the sword of Cû’jara-Cinmoi. With the subsequent conquest of [[Cil-Aujas]] to the south, Siöl and her High King commanded an empire that ranged from the [[Yimaleti Mountains]] to the [[Meneanor|Sea of Meneanor]].

During this time, the Watch was kept on the Ark. The land cooled. The skies cleared.

==The Destruction of the Watch==
Either because of original inconsistencies or because of subsequent corruptions, extant version of the ''Isûphiryas'' are unclear as to the subsequent order of events. At some point a secret embassy of Inchoroi reached Nin’janjin at Viri. Unlike the Inchoroi brought to Cû’jara-Cinmoi by Ingalira, these possessed the ability to speak Ihrimsû. They reminded Nin’janjin of Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s treachery in his time of need, and offered an alliance to break the yoke of Siöl over Viri. They would undo, the Inchoroi said, the misfortune their coming had wrought upon the Cûnuroi of Viri.

Despite the warnings of his Ishroi, Nin’janjin accepted the Inchoroi terms. Viri revolted. The Siölan Ishroi within its halls were slain; the rest were enslaved. At the same time, the Inchoroi swarmed from the Ark, overwhelming the Watch. Only [[Oirinas]] and his twin, [[Oirûnas]], survived, riding hard to warn Cû’jara-Cinmoi.

==The Slaying of Sil==
[[Sil]], the Inchoroi King, and Nin’janjin assembled their hosts to meet Cû’jara-Cinmoi on the [[Fields of Eleneöt|Fields of Pir Pahal]], which [[Men]] would call Eleneöt in a later age. According to the ''Isûphiryas,'' the Nonmen of Viri were dismayed by the sight of their allies, who wore fierce and festering bodies as garments of war. [[Gin’gûrima]], the greatest hero among them, pointed to Nin’janjin and declared, “Hate has blinded him.” This treason within a treason was repeated by others, until it became a thundering chorus. Nin’janjin fled, seeking protection from Sil. The Inchoroi then turned upon their allies, hoping to destroy the host of Viri before Cû’jara-Cinmoi and the great host of Siöl could close with them.

Overmatched by the Inchoroi and their weapons of light, the Nonmen of Viri were driven back with horrendous losses. Only Cû’jara-Cinmoi and his Ishroi Chariots saved them from utter destruction. The chroniclers of the ''Isûphiryas'' claim the battle raged through the night and into the following morning. Eventually, all but the most powerful of the Inchoroi were overwhelmed by the valour, [[sorcery|sorceries]], and numbers of the host of Siöl. Cû’jara-Cinmoi himself struck down Sil, and wrested from him his great weapon, Suörgil, “Shining Death,” which Men in a latter age would call the [[Heron Spear]].

Much reduced, the Inchoroi fled back to their Ark, taking Nin’janjin with them. Cû’jara-Cinmoi hunted them within sight of the [[Ring Mountains]], but was forced to abandon his pursuit when word of further disasters reached him. Emboldened by Siöl’s distraction, Nihrimsul and Cil-Aujas had revolted.

==The Second Watch==
Weakened by the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], Cû’jara-Cinmoi was hard pressed to recover his empire. A Second Watch was put upon the Holoinas, but no attempt was made to breach the gold-grooved faces of the Ark. After years of hard campaigning, Cû’jara-Cinmoi finally brought the Ishroi of Cil-Aujas to heel, but King Sin’niroiha and the Ishroi of Nihrimsul continued to resist him. The ''Isûphiryas'' chronicles dozens of bloody yet indecisive confrontations between the two Kings: the Battle of Ciphara, the Battle of Hilcyri, the Siege of Asargoi. Proud beyond reason, Cû’jara-Cinmoi refused to relent, and put to death every embassy Sin’niroiha sent to him. Only when Sin’niroiha became King of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]] through marriage did the High King of Siöl concede. “A King of Three Mansions,” he is said to have declared, “may be Brother to a King of Two.”

The ''Isûphiryas'' mentions the Inchoroi only once during this time. Unwilling to assign desperately needed Ishroi to the Second Watch, Cû’jara-Cinmoi had charged Oirinas and Oirûnas, the sole survivors of the First Watch, with recruiting Men for the duty. Among these Halaroi was a “criminal” named [[Sirwitta]]. Apparently Sirwitta had seduced the wife of a high-ranking Ishroi and conceived by her a daughter named [[Cimoira]]. The Judges of the Ishroi were perplexed: such a thing had never happened before. The truth of Cimoira was suppressed, and despite her mannish blood she was accepted as Cûnuroi. Sirwitta himself was banished to the Second Watch.

Somehow (the ''Isûphiryas'' does not go into detail) Sirwitta managed to enter the Incû-Holoinas. A month passed, and all thought him lost. Then he reappeared, deranged, screeching claims so alarming that Oirinas and Oirûnas brought him directly to Cû’jara-Cinmoi. What was said between Sirwitta and the High King of Siöl is not recorded. The chroniclers say only that Cû’jara-Cinmoi, after hearing Sirwitta speak, ordered him put to death. A later entry, however, described Sirwitta as “tongueless and imprisoned.” It appears the High King, for some unknown reason, had rescinded his warrant.

Many years of peace followed. From their fortresses in the Ring Mountains, the Ishroi of Siöl guarded the Ark. Whether the Inchoroi lived still or had perished, no one knew. Cû’jara-Cinmoi grew old, for the Nonmen of those days were still mortal. His eyesight dimmed, and his once-mighty limbs began to fail him. Death whispered to him.

==The Womb-Plague==
Then Nin’janjin returned. Invoking the ancient codes, he appeared before Cû’jara-Cinmoi begging Mercy and Penance. When the High King of Siöl bid Nin’janjin come near so he might see him, he was astonished to discover his old adversary had not aged. Then Nin’janjin revealed his true reason for coming to Siöl. The Inchoroi, he said, were too terrified of Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s might to leave their Ark, so they dwelt in confinement and misery. They had sent him, he claimed, to sue for peace. They wished to know what tribute might temper the High King’s fury.

To which Cû’jara-Cinmoi replied: “I would be young of heart, face, and limb. I would banish Death from the halls of my people."

The Second Watch was disbanded and the Inchoroi moved freely among the Cûnuroi of Siöl, becoming their physicians. They ministered to all, dispensing the remedies that would at once make the Nonmen immortal and doom them. Soon all the Cûnuroi of [[Eärwa]], even those who had initially questioned Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s wisdom, had succumbed to the Inchoroi and their nostrums.

According to the ''Isûphiryas,'' the first victim of the [[Womb Plague|Womb-Plague]] was [[Hanalinqû]], Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s legendary wife. The chronicler actually praises the diligence and skill of the High King’s Inchoroi physicians. But as the Womb-Plague killed more and more Cûnuroi women, this praise becomes condemnation. Soon all the women of the Cûnuroi, wives and maidens both, were dying. The Inchoroi fled the Mansions, returning to their ruined vessel.

==The Fall of Cû’jara-Cinmoi==
Ishroi from across Eärwa answered Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s call to war, even though many held the High King responsible for the deaths of their beloved. Grieved almost to madness, the High King led them through the Ring Mountains and arrayed them across the [[Inniür-Shigogli]], the “Black Furnace Plain.” Then he laid Hanalinqû’s corpse before the unholy Ark and demanded the Inchoroi answer his fury.

But the Inchoroi had not been idle over the long years since the Battle of Pir Pahal. They had delved deep into the earth, beneath the Inniür-Shigogli and out into the Ring Mountains. Within these galleries they had massed hordes of twisted creatures unlike any the Cûnuroi had ever seen: [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag]]s, and mighty [[Wracu|Dragon]]s. The Ishroi of the Nine High Mansions of Eärwa, who had come to destroy the diminished survivors of Pir Pahal, found themselves beset on all sides.

The Sranc withered before the sinew and sorcery of the Ishroi, but their numbers seemed inexhaustible. The Bashrags and the Dragons exacted a horrifying toll. More terrible still were those few Inchoroi who ventured out into battle, hanging above the tumult, sweeping the earth with their weapons of light, apparently unaffected by the sorceries of the Ishroi. After the disaster of Pir Pahal, the Inchoroi had seduced the practitioners of the [[Aporos]], who had been forbidden from pursuing their art. Poisoned by knowledge, they devised the first of the [[Chorae]] to render their masters immune to Cûnuroi magic.

But all the heroes of Eärwa stood upon the Black Furnace Plain. With his bare hands, [[Ciögli|Ciögli the Mountain]], the strongest of the Ishroi, broke the neck of [[Wutteät|Wutteät the Black]], the Father of Dragons. Oirinas and Oirûnas fought side by side, working great carnage among the Sranc and Bashrags. Ingalira, the hero of Siöl, strangled [[Vshikcrû]], mighty among the Inchoroi, and cast his burning body into the Sranc.

The mighty closed with the mighty, and innumerable battles were fought. But no matter how hard the Inchoroi pressed, the Cûnuroi would yield no ground. Their fury was that of those who have lost wives and daughters.

Then Nin’janjin struck down Cû’jara-Cinmoi.

The Copper Tree of Siöl fell into pitching masses of Sranc, and the Cûnuroi were dismayed. Sin’niroiha, the High King of Nihrimsul and Ishoriöl, fought his way to Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s position, but found only his headless body. Then the hero Gin’gûrima fell, gored by a Dragon. And after him Ingalira, who had been the first to lay eyes upon the Inchoroi. Then Oirinas, his body sundered by an Inchoroi spear of light.

Realizing their plight, Sin’niroiha rallied his people and began fighting his way into the Ring Mountains. A greater part of the surviving Cûnuroi followed him. Once clear of their foe, the glorious Ishroi of Eärwa fled, gripped by a mad fear. Either too weakened or suspecting a trap, the Inchoroi did not pursue.

==The War of Extermination==
For five hundred years the Cûnuroi and the Inchoroi waged a war of extermination, the Cûnuroi to avenge their murdered wives and the eventual death of their race, and the Inchoroi for reasons they alone could fathom. No longer did the Cûnuroi speak of the Incû-Holoinas, the Ark-of-the-Skies. Instead they spoke of Min-Uroikas, “the Pit of Obscenities”—what would later be called [[Golgotterath]] by Men. For centuries it seemed the abominations had the upper hand, and the poets of the ''Isûphiryas'' record defeat after defeat. But slowly, as the Inchoroi exhausted their fell weapons and relied more and more on their vile slaves, the Cûnuroi and their Halaroi servants gained the advantage. Then at long last the surviving Ishroi of Eärwa trapped the last of their diminished foe within the Incû-Holoinas. For twenty years they warred through the Ark’s labyrinthine halls, finally hunting the last of the Inchoroi into the deep places of the earth. Unable to destroy the vessel, [[Nil’giccas]] instructed the remaining [[Qûya]] to raise a powerful glamour about the hated place. He and the surviving kings of the Nine Mansions forbade their peoples from mentioning the Inchoroi or their nightmarish legacy. The last Cûnuroi of Eärwa withdrew to their Mansions to await their inevitable doom.

Little is known about Sil's background; he was not a king before the Arkfall and only rose to leadership of his people and taught them to wage war after their landing in [[Eärwa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com.cy/2017/05/quote-of-day_5.html Fantasy Hotlist: ''Quote of the Day'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bashrags''' are creations of the [[Inchoroi]] [[Tekne]].

==Nature==
Bashrag are one of the Weapon Races created by the Inchoroi to fight the [[Nonmen]] during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt; Like all of the Weapon Races, they exist only to kill and destroy.

==Physiology==
Bashrags have the appearance of three bodies fused into one. Each of their arms is composed of three arms fused together, with three hands as fingers. They have three faces on their heads, a central one and one on each cheek. Their bodies are covered in hairy moles.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nil’giccas''' is the [[Nonman]] King of [[Ishterebinth]] and [[Nihrimsûl]], eldest son of [[Sin’niroiha]] and [[Tsinirû]]. Known as King-upon-the-Summit, Lightbearer, Mantutor and many other names in the legends and histories of [[Men]] and Nonmen.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic Glossary II, "Nil'giccas"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, while with the [[Skin Eaters]], he went by the names '''Incariol'''&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Cleric'''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Nin.png|thumb|300px]]

==Appearance==
Like all Nonmen, Nil’giccas has white skin and lacks body hair.

&lt;br /&gt;

==Personality==
Nil’giccas is an amnesiac, as a result of his unnaturally long life. This made him an [[Erratic]], a Nonman driven insane by the slow loss of his memory. He is prone to give long, rambling, sermon-like speeches each night, which led to him receiving the nickname “Cleric.”

&lt;br /&gt;

==Skills==
Nil’giccas is a powerful [[Qûya]], perhaps the mightiest one alive.

&lt;br /&gt;

==Story==
&lt;br /&gt;
===''What Came Before''===
Nil’giccas was born a long time before the beginning of the ancient [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], making him over four thousand years old. He had a wife who died as a result of the Womb-Plague created by the [[Inchoroi]]. He became the High King of the Nonmen after the death of [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] and continued fighting the age-long struggle that would be known as the Cûno-Inchoroi Wars. After hundreds of years, Nil’giccas and his Nonmen prevailed in the war of annihilation and finally penetrated into the [[Incû-Holoinas]] itself. Nil’giccas led the final victory over the Inchoroi, driving them to extinction. When his forces were unable to destroy the Incû-Holoinas, he had the remaining Qûya [[sorcerer]]s hide it from sight with a powerful glamour.

Thousands of years later, an aged Nil’giccas participated in the Great Ordeal organized against [[Golgotterath]] in the early years of the [[Apocalypse]], during which time he was apparently close friends with [[Seswatha]]. However his last sons died in the [[Consult]] counterattack which ended the Great Investiture, and a deeply embittered Nil’giccas abandoned the war.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Apocalypse’&lt;/ref&gt;

Another millennium later, when the last surviving Nonmen of the Mansion of [[Ishterebinth]] decided to join forces with the Consult, a disillusioned Nil’giccas abandoned them due to his pride.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; He became an [[Erratic]] and took on the name Incariol. He eventually joined the [[Skin Eaters]] in hunting [[Sranc]] for the [[Holy Bounty]] on their pelts, with their leader [[Kosoter]] becoming his [[elju]].

&lt;br /&gt;

===''The Judging Eye''===
The Skin Eaters are hired by [[Drusas Achamian]] to find the [[Coffers]] of the long-fallen [[Library of Sauglish]]. The long and perilous journey requires them to travel through the fallen Mansion of [[Cil-Aujas]]. Inside the Mansion, Nil’giccas gives his travelling companions their first taste of the drug [[qirri]].

In the black depths of Cil-Aujas, Nil’giccas becomes possessed by the spirit of the long-dead Nonman King [[Gin’yursis]]. [[Mimara]] manages to exorcise the ancient wight, and Nil’giccas rejoins his companions.

&lt;br /&gt;

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
The Skin Eaters continue their journey towards the Library of Sauglish, becoming increasingly addicted to Nil’giccas’s supply of qirri along the way.

Nil’giccas assists Achamian in defeating the ancient dragon [[Wutteät]]. However, because he has fallen in love with Mimara and sees Achamian as a good friend, he then attempts to kill them, as his grief over their deaths would be the only way he would be able to remember them. He and Achamian fight a sorcerous duel over the ruins of Sauglish, where Achamian reluctantly kills the ancient Nonman.

Afterwards Achamian burns Nil’giccas’s body and makes qirri from the ashes.

[[File:Captain_sm.jpg|thumb|300px|Lord Kosoter, Holy Veteran, Ironsoul, the Captain of the Skin Eaters.]]

'''Kosoter''' is head of the [[Skin Eaters]] and [[elju]] to the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Nil’giccas]].

==Appearance==
He is described as having a square beard.

==Story==
===''What Came Before''===
Kosoter participated in the [[Holy War]]. After the Battle of Em’famir, Aspect-Emperor [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] gave him the name “Ironsoul.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Holy Bounty on [[Sranc]] pelts was announced, he founded the Skin Eaters.

===''The Judging Eye''===
Kosoter’s group, the Skin Eaters, are hired by [[Drusas Achamian]] to raid the legendary Coffers of the ruined [[Library of Sauglish]].

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
Kosoter, like the rest of the Skin Eaters, becomes addicted to the [[qirri]] dispensed by Nil’giccas.

He is ultimately slain in the ruins of [[Sauglish]] when his men [[Galian]] and [[Xonghis]] betray him.

The '''Skin Eaters''' are a group of mercenaries who hunt [[Sranc]] for the Holy Bounty placed on their scalps. The group is significant for having a reputation as the fiercest and most successful group of scalpers in [[Marrow]], and for including a [[Nonman]] [[Quya]] as a member.

Though the group begins [[The Judging Eye (Book) | The Judging Eye]] nearly thirty strong, by the end of [[The White-Luck Warrior (Book)|The White-Luck Warrior]] only [[Sarl]] is left alive.

The group's leader is [[Kosoter]].

Though the Nonmen were made immortal by the [[Inchoroi]], their memories are still fallible. As time goes by, they end up forgetting more and more of their long lives. Some Nonmen try to fight the inevitable loss of their memory by having an elju travel with them, to constantly remind them of their past deeds.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="469">An '''Erratic''' is a [[Nonman]] who has been driven insane by memory loss.

While the [[Inchoroi]] made the Nonmen immortal, their memories are still limited. After thousands upon thousands of years of life, Nonmen are only capable of remembering the most painful and traumatic experiences of their lives. Erratics are driven to destroy the things they love and cherish most, in order to ensure that they will not forget them.

The '''Battle of Pir Pahal''' was a battle between the [[Nonmen]] and the [[Inchoroi]]. It marked the end of the first of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].

The battle began when the Nonmen of [[Viri]] serving [[Nin’janjin]] and the Inchoroi gathered on the [[Fields of Eleneöt|Fields of Pir Pahal]] to face the army of [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]. However, the Nonmen of Viri were appalled when they actually looked upon the Inchoroi, and turned on Nin’janjin, who attempted to flee. The Inchoroi then turned on the Nonmen, hoping to destroy them before Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s forces arrived.

Though the Inchoroi did inflict horrendous casualties on the Nonmen of Viri, Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s forces arrived to save them from total destruction. The subsequent battle is said to have raged through the night and into the following morning.

The battle ended when Cû’jara-Cinmoi killed [[Sil]], the Inchoroi King, and retrieved the [[Heron Spear]] from his corpse. The surviving Inchoroi forces were forced to retreat to the [[Incû-Holoinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the White [[Norsirai]] of the north shore of the [[Cerish|Cerish Sea]] lacked any sustained contact with the [[Nonmen]], they gradually became the second great seat of Norsirai civilization. Akksersia was founded in 811 by [[Salaweärn I]], following the dissolution of the [[Cond]] Yoke. Though confined to the city of [[Myclai]], her commercial and administrative capital, the nation gradually expanded its hegemony, first along the length of the [[River Tywanrae]], then across the [[Plains of Gâl]] and the entire north shore of the Cerish Sea. By the time of the First Great Sranc War in 1251, it was the largest of the ancient Norsirai nations, incorporating almost all the White Norsirai tribes save those of the [[Istyuli Plains]].

It fell to the [[No-God]] after three disastrous defeats in 2149. Akkserian colonists on the Cerish Sea’s heavily forested south shore would form the nucleus of what would become the [[Meöri Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Akksersia’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">'''Amoteu''' is a governorate of [[Kian]], located on the southern edge of the [[Meneanor|Meneanor Sea]].

Like all the nations in the shadow of the [[Betmulla Mountains]], Amoteu, or Holy Amoteu as it is sometimes called, grew in the influential shadow of Old Dynasty [[Shigek]]. According to extant inscriptions, the Shigeki referred to both [[Xerash]] and Amoteu as Hut-Jartha, the “Land of the Jarti,” or as Huti-Parota, the “Middle-Lands.” The [[Jarti]] were the dominant [[Ketyai]] tribe of the region, to which the [[Amoti]] and several others were tributaries before the Shigeki conquest. But with the extensive cultivation of the [[Shairizor Plains]], and the slow rise of [[Shimeh]] and [[Kyudea]] along the [[River Jeshimal]], the balance of power slowly shifted. For centuries the Middle-Lands found themselves the battleground between Shigek and her southern competitors, [[Eumarna]] across the Betmulla Mountains and ancient or Vapartic [[Nilnamesh]]. In 1322, [[Anzumarapata II]], the Nilnameshi King of [[Invishi]], crushed the Shigeki and, in an effort to secure his conquests, transplanted hundreds of thousands of indigent Nilnameshi on the [[Plains of Heshor]], an act that would long outlive his brief empire (the Shigeki reconquered the Middle-Lands in 1349). With the collapse of Shigeki regional dominance in 1591, the Jarti attempted to reassert their ancestral control—with disastrous consequences. The resulting war gave rise to a brief Amoti Empire, which reached the length of Betmulla to the frontier of the [[Carathay Desert]]. All the Middle-Lands would fall under the power of Kyraneas in 1703.

With the dissolution of [[Kyraneas]], c. 2158, Amoteu enjoyed its second—and last—period of independence, though now the [[Xerash]]i, the descendants of Anzumarapata’s settlers, had become its primary competitors. This second “golden age” would witness [[Inri Sejenus]], and the slow growth of the faith that would eventually come to dominate the [[Three Seas]]. After a brief period of Xerashi occupation, Amoteu would suffer a long succession of foreign overlords, each leaving its own stamp: first the [[Ceneian Empire|Ceneian]]s, who conquered the Middle-Lands in 2414, then the [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] in 3574, and finally the [[Kian]]ene in 3845. Despite the peace and prosperity enjoyed by other conquered provinces, the early years of Ceneian rule would prove particularly bloody for Amoteu. In 2458, while [[Triamis the Great]] was still in his infancy, [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] fanatics led the province in a vicious rebellion against Cenei. As punishment, Emperor [[Siaxas II]] butchered the inhabitants of Kyudea and razed the city to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Amoteu’&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sapatishah-Governor of Amoteu is [[Dunjoksha]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Dunjoksha’&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on it's proximity to the [[Betmulla Mountains]], this lesser mansion likely swore fealty to the Great Mansion of [[Illisserû]].

'''Angeshraël''' is the most famed Old Prophet of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]], responsible for leading the [[Five Tribes of Men]] into [[Eärwa]]. Also known as the Burnt Prophet for bowing his face into his fire after confronting [[Husyelt]] at the foot of [[Mount Eshki]]. His wife was named [[Esmenet (Tusk)|Esmenet]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Angeshraël’&lt;/ref&gt;

Angeshraël had a son by Esmenet, [[Oresh]], but sacrificed him at [[Mount Kinsureah]] to demonstrate his conviction to the Tribes of Men.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Mount Kinsureah’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
{{blockquote|“The Prophet Angeshraël came down from his fast on Mount Eshki. Husyelt, the Tusk tells us, sent a hare to him, so he might eat at last. Angeshraël skinned the Hunter’s gift and struck a fire so he might feast. When he had eaten and was content, sacred Husyelt, the Holy Stalker, joined him at his fire, for the Gods in those days had not left the world in the charge of Men. Angeshraël, recognizing the God as the God, fell immediately to his knees before the fire, not thinking where he would throw his face.”&lt;br /&gt;“Like a young man on his wedding night, he erred in his eagerness …”&lt;br /&gt;“And the God said, ‘Why does our Prophet fall to his knees only? Are not Prophets Men like other Men? Should they not throw their faces to the earth?’ To which Angeshraël replied, ‘I find my fire be­fore me.’ And peer­less Husyelt said, ‘The fire burns across earth, and what fire con­sumes be­comes earth. I am your God. Throw your face to the earth.’”&lt;br /&gt;“So Angeshraël, the Tusk tells us, bowed his head into the flames.”|The Chronicle of the Tusk&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Mengedda.jpg|thumb|300px|At the urging of Seswatha, founder of the School of Mandate, Anaxophus V, High King of Kyraneas, wields the Heron Spear against the No-God at Mengedda, thus ending the First Apocalypse.]]
The '''Apocalypse''' was a protracted series of wars and atrocities that obliterated the Ancient North.

==Causes==

The roots of the Apocalypse are many and deep. [[Mandate]] scholars (who, popular opinion to the contrary, are not recognized authorities on the subject) argue that they are older than recorded history. More sober accounts reach back no further than the so-called Nonman Tutelage, which eventually led the Gnostic [[The Schools|School]] of [[Mangaecca]] to the site of the [[Incû-Holoinas]], the Ark-of-the-Skies, where it lay protected, hidden by [[Nonmen]] glamors in the shadow of the western [[Yimaleti Mountains]]. Accounts are incomplete, but it seems clear that what were called the Great Sranc Wars were a consequence of the Mangaecca occuption of what would come to be called [[Golgotterath]].

Traditionally, scholars date the beginning of the Apocalypse with [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]]'s call for a holy war against Golgotterath, his Great Ordeal, which is to say, with the beginning of the accounts found in ''[[The Sagas]]'', the primary historical source text for this cataclysmic event. Legend has it that the Nonmen [[Siqû]] informed the Grandmaster of the [[Sohonc]] (the pre-eminent [[Sauglish]] School) that the Mangaecca, or [[Consult]] as they had come to be called, had uncovered lost [[Inchoroi]] secrets that would lead to the world's destruction. [[Seswatha]] in turn convinced Celmomas to declare war on Golgotterath in 2123.

==The Great Ordeal==

There has been much debate regarding the next twenty years, and much severe criticism of the pride and bickering that would eventually destroy the Ordeal. What most fail to realize is that the threat facing the High [[Norsirai]] of [[Kûniüri]] and [[Aörsi]] at this time was entirely hypothetical. In fact, it is surprising that Celmomas was able to hold his coalition, which included Nonmen as well as token contingents of [[Kyranean]]s, together for as long as he did.

The first great battle, fought in 2124 on the fields of [[Agongorea]], was indecisive. Celmomas and his allies wintered in [[Dagliash]] and forded the [[River Sursa]] the following spring, catching their foe unawares. The Consult withdrew to Golgotterath, and so began what would be called the Great Investiture. For six years the Ordeal attempted to starve the Consult into submission, to no avail. Every assault proved disastrous. Then, in 2131, after a dispute with King [[Anasûrimbor Nimeric]] of Aörsi, Celmomas himself abandoned his own Holy War. The following year disaster struck. Consult legions, apparently using a vast subterranean network of tunnels, appeared in the [[Ring Mountains]] to the rear of the Ordeal. The coalition host was all but destroyed. Embittered by the loss of his sons, [[Nil'giccas]], the Nonman King of Ishterebinth, withdrew altogether, leaving the Aörsi to war alone.

==The Fall Of Aörsi==

The following years witnessed a string of further disasters. In 2133 the Aörsi were defeated at the Passes of Amnerlot, and Daliash was lost soon after. King Nimeric withdrew to his capital of [[Shiarau]]. A year passed before Celmomas acknowledged his folly and mobilized to relieve him. By then it was too late. In 2135, Nimeric was mortally wounded in the [[Battle of Hamuir]], and Shiarau fell to the Consult legions the following spring. The Aörsic house of Anasûrimbor had perished forever.

Now it was Kûniüri that stood alone. His credibility destroyed, Celmomas was unable to rally any allies, and for a time the situation seemed bleak. But in 2137 his youngest son, [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]], managed to rout the Consult at the [[Battle of Ossirish]], where he earned the name Murswagga, or "Dragonslayer", for killing [[Tanhafut]] the Red. His next victory, within sight of Shiarau's ruins, was more complete still. The Consult's remaining [[Sranc]] and [[Bashrag]] fled across the River Sursa. In 2139 the young Prince besieged and recaptured Dagliash, then launched several spectacular raids across the Plains of Agongorea.

==Raid Of The Incû-Holoinas==

Then, in 2140, Nau-Cayûti's beloved concubine, [[Aulisi]], was abducted by Sranc marauders and taken to Golgotterath. According to ''The Sagas'', Seswatha was able to convince the Prince (who was once his student) that she could be rescued from the [[Incû-Holoinas]], and the two of them embarked on an expedition that is almost certainly apocryphal. Mandate commentators dispute the account found in ''The Sagas'', where they successfully return with both Aulisi and the [[Heron Spear]], claiming that Aulisi was never found. Whatever happened, at least two things are certain: the Heron Spear was in fact recovered, and Nau-Cayûti died shortly after (apparently poisoned by his first wife, [[Iëva]]).

==Awakening Of The No-God==

In 2141, the Consult returned to the offensive, wrongly thinking the Kûniüri crippled by the loss of their greatest and most beloved son. But Nau-Cayûti's mead-brothers proved themselves able, even brilliant, commanders. At the [[Battle of Skothera]], the Sranc hordes were crushed by General [[En-Kaujalau]], though he died of mysterious causes within weeks of this victory (according to ''The Sagas'', he was another victim of Iëva and her poisons, but again this is disputed by Mandate scholars). In 2142, General [[Sag-Marmau]] inflicted yet another crushing defeat on [[Aurang]] and his Consult legions, and by the fall of that year he had hounded the remnant of their horde to the Gates of Golgotterath itself.

But the Second Great Investiture proved far shorter than the first. As Seswatha had feared, the Consult had been merely playing for time, nothing more. In the spiring of 2143 the [[No-God]], summoned by means unknown, first drew breath. Across the world, [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag]], and [[Wracu]] -- all the obscene progeny of the Inchoroi -- hearkened to his call. [[Sag-Marmau]] and the greater glory of [[Kûniüri]] were annihilated.

The effect of his coming cannot be overestimated. As numerous independent accounts attest, all [[Men]] could sense his dread presence on the horizon, and all infants were born dead. Anasûrimbor Celmomas II had little difficulty gathering support for his Second Ordeal. [[Nil'giccas]] and Celmomas were reconciled. Across [[Eärwa]], hosts of Men began marching towards Kûniüri.

But it was too late.

==The Years Of The Crib==

Celmomas and his Second Ordeal were destroyed on the [[Fields of Eleneöt]] in 2146. The Heron Spear, which could not be used because the No-God refused to give battle, was lost. Kûniüri and all the great and ancient cities of the [[River Aumris]] were destroyed the following year. The Nonmen of Injor-Niyas retreated to Ishterebinth. [[Eämnor]] was laid waste the year after, though its capital, [[Atrithau]], raised on anarcane ground, managed to survive. The list continues. [[Akksersia]] and [[Harmant]] in 2149. The [[Meöri Empire]] in 2150. Inweära in 2151, though the city of [[Sakarpus]] was spared. The [[Shiradi Empire]] in 2153.

The [[Battle of Kathol Pass]], fought primarily by the remnants of the Meöri and the Nonmen of [[Cil-Aujas]] in the autumn of 2151, would be mankind's only victory during these dark years, one which was entirely undone when the Meöri turned on their benefactors and sacked the ancient Nonman Mansion the following spring (which gave birth to the myth that the [[Galeoth]], the descendants of those Meöri refugees, were forever cursed with treachery and fractiousness).

Though defeated at the [[Battle of Mehsarunath]] in 2154, [[Anaxophus V]], the High King of Kyraneas, managed to save the core of his host and fled southward, abandoning [[Mehtsonc]] and [[Sumna]] to the [[Scylvendi]]. The [[Tusk]] was evacuated and brought to ancient [[Invishi]] in [[Nilnamesh]]. Though the historical record is scant, Mandate scholars insist that it was at this time that the High King admitted to Seswatha that his knights had rescued the Heron Spear from the Fields of Eleneöt eight years previously.

==The Slaying Of The No-God==

Perhaps no single event from this dark time has inspired more acrimony and debate among Three Seas scholars of the Apocalypse. Some historians, the great [[Casidas]] among them, have called this the most monstrous deception in history. How could Anaxophus conceal the only weapon that could defeat the No-God while the greater part of the world died? But others, including many belonging to the Mandate, argue precisely the opposite. They admit that Anaxophus's motive -- to save Kyraneas and Kyraneas alone -- was more than a little suspect. But they point to the fact that had he not hidden the Heron Spear, it would surely have been lost in the catastrophes following the Fields of Eleneöt and the Second Ordeal. According to extant accounts, not once did the No-God expose himself to battle during this time. It was the years of attrition that forced him to intercede in the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]].

Whatever the case, the No-God, or Tsuramah as the Kyraneans called him, was destroyed by Anaxophus V in 2155. Freed of his terrible will, his Sranc, Bashrag, and Wracu slaves dispersed. The Apocalypse had ended, and Men set out to recover what they could of a ruined world.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Apocalypse’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1897">'''Inrithism''' is the faith founded upon the revelations of [[Inri Sejenus]], the Latter Prophet, which synthesizes elements of both monotheism and polytheism. The central tenents of Inrithism deal with the immanence of the God in historical events, the unity of the individual [[Gods|deities]] of the [[Cults]] as Aspects of the [[God of Gods|God]], and the role of the [[Thousand Temples]] as the very expression of the God in the world.

Following the alleged ascension of Inri Sejenus, Inrithism slowly established itself throughout the [[Ceneian Empire]] as an organized hierarchy independent of the state—what came to be called the Thousand Temples. Initially, the existing traditionalist [[Kiünnat]] sects simply dismissed the new religion, but as it continued to grow, a number of attempts were made to circumscribe its powers and prevent its further spread, none of them particularly effective. Escalating tensions eventually culminated in the [[Zealot Wars]] (c. 2390-2478), which, although technically a civil war, saw battles fought far outside the boundaries of what then constituted the Ceneian Empire.

In 2469, [[Sumna]] capitulated to Shrial forces, but hostilities continued until [[Triamis the Great]] was anointed Emperor in 2478. Though himself Inrithi (converted by [[Ekyannus III]]), and despite enacting the constitution governing the division of powers between the Imperium and the Thousand Temples, he refrained from declaring Inrithism the official state religion until 2505. From that point the ascendancy of the Thousand Temples was assured, and over the ensuing centuries the remaining Kiünnat “heresies” of the [[Three Seas]] would either wither away or be forcibly stamped out.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Inrithism’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">'''Fanimry''' is a monotheistic faith founded upon the revelations of the Prophet [[Fane]].

The central tenets of Fanimry deal with the solitary nature and transcendence of the [[God of Gods|God]], the falseness of the Hundred [[Gods]] (who are considered demons by the Fanim), the repudiation of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]] as unholy, and the prohibition of all representations of the God.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Fanimry’&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Despite the many sects within the religion, all are founded upon variant interpretations of the kipfa’aifan, the “Witness of Fane,” which contains the narration of the Prophet’s experiences following his apostasy as a priest in the Thousand Temples and subsequent banishment into the wilds of the Carathay Desert.&lt;br&gt;
  All Fanim, regardless of their sect, are enjoined to practice Dwiva, the Twelve Disciplines, the rigours which the desert forces upon those who would survive it (thus transforming, as Farjanjua, the great Invitic Inrithi critic of the upstart religion would declare, the deprivations suffered by all desert pastoralists into sacred rules of conduct). Almost every variant of the faith finds its distinction in its interpretation of the meaning and importance of various strictures named in the Dwiva. Either because of Fane’s training as an Inrithi priest or his keen understanding of his spiritual competitors, the new faith almost immediately developed its own tradition of rational theology. The greatest sectarian divide predates the White Jihad in 3743, the product of a legendary dispute between the two most prominent and strong-willed disciples of Fane, Masurkur and Narunshinde. As the senior spiritual and military advisors of Fan’oukarji I (who always called them his “Bickering Crows”), both actively advocated drastically different interpretations of Dwiva, and so, starkly different visions of the future of Fanimry. For Masurkur, only a strict and violent interpretation of the Twelve Disciplines assured passage to paradise. He advocated the “Pok Harit” the One Direction, giving birth to the Pokariti, the first ascetic, militant strand of Fanimry. For Narunshinde, on the other hand, belief in the Prophet alone was enough to gain entrance, with the Dwiva acting primarily as an aspirational ideal. He advocated the Somha Jil, or the Clasped Hand, a far more inclusive—and from the standpoint of conversion—a far more marketable version of the faith. His followers, which came to form the decided majority, were known as the Sumajil. Fan’oukarji I would become notorious for using Pokariti or Sumajil justifications opportunistically, either to rationalize his many cruelties, or his just as numerous acts of generosity. He actively encouraged the institutionalization of both schools of interpretation after the deaths of both disciples, apparently assuming they would prove as useful to his successors as they had to him, rather than forming the chasm that would claim countless lives in the centuries that followed.

The symbol and primary holy device of Fanimry is the Two Scimitars (Twin Scimitars), symbolizing the “Cutting Eyes” of the [[Solitary God]]: “one for the Unbeliever Eye, and one for the Unseeing Eye.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Twin Scimitars’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fane''' was the Prophet of the [[Solitary God]], founder of [[Fanimry]] and first of the [[Cishaurim]].

Initially a Shrial Priest in the [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] province of [[Eumarna]], Fane was declared a heretic by the ecclesiastical courts of the [[Thousand Temples]] in 3703 and banished to certain death in the [[Carathay Desert]]. According to Fanim tradition, rather than dying in the desert, Fane went blind, experienced the series of revelations narrated in the ''[[kipfa’aifan]]'' (the “Witness of Fane” in Kianni), and was granted miraculous powers (the same powers attributed to the Cishaurim) he called the Water of Indara. He spent the remainder of his life preaching to and consolidating the desert tribes of the [[Kian]]ene, who after his death would launch the [[White Jihad]] under the leadership of Fane’s son, [[Fan’oukarji I]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Fane’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fan’oukarji I''' (“Peerless son of Fane” in Kianni), was the eldest son of the Prophet [[Fane]] and the first [[Padirajah]] of [[Kian]]. Fan’oukarji is credited with the fantastic success of the [[White Jihad]] against the [[Nansur Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Fan’oukarji I’&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in 3771, Fan’oukarji I had conquered all of [[Mongilea]] and had made serious inroads into [[Eumarna]]. He had also founded his capital, [[Nenciphon]], on the banks of the [[River Sweki]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kian’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1281">'''Aörsi''' is a lost nation of the [[Ancient North]].

Aörsi was founded in the 1556 partitioning of Greater [[Kûniüri]] between the sons of [[Anasûrimbor Nanor-Ukkerja I]] at his death. Even contemporaries recognized Aörsi as the most warlike of the ancient [[Norsirai]] nations, though her ambitions remained uniquely defensive rather than expansionist. Sparsely populated save for the regions surrounding her capital, [[Shiarau]], Aörsi faced considerable and unrelenting pressure from the [[Sranc]] and [[Bashrag]] tribes of th [[Yimaleti Mountains]] to the north, not to mention the [[Consult]] legions of [[Golgotterath]] across the [[River Sursa]] to the west -- a challenge that would spur the construction of [[Dagliash]], the greatest fortress of the age. It is no accident that the word ''sursa'' came to mean "front line" across the Ancient North.

Aörsi's history is one of ingenuity and determination in the face of neverending crises. Perhaps it is fitting that her destruction in 2136 during the [[Apocalypse]] was due more to the betrayal of her southern Kûniüri cousins than to any real failure on the part of [[Anasûrimbor Nimeric]], her final King&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 412, 'Aörsi'&lt;/ref&gt;.

The imperial garrison stationed at Asgilioch is commanded by [[Harus Prophilas]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Prophilas, Harus’&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Anwurat''' was a pivotal battle of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]], fought in the summer of 4111 about the fortress of [[Anwurat]] south of the [[River Sempis|Sempis Delta]].

Despite early setbacks, the [[Inrithi]] under [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] managed to rout the [[Kianene]] host of [[Skauras ab Nalajan]], allowing the subsequent conquest of southern [[Shigek]] and opening the road to [[Caraskand]].{{EG|Battle of Anwurat}}

The '''Battle of Caraskand''', sometimes called the '''Battle of Tertae Fields''', was the desperate and pivotal battle in 4112 between the host of [[Kascamandri ab Tepherokar]], the Padirajah of [[Kian]], and the [[Holy War|First Holy War]] under [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].

The [[Fanim]], despite outnumbering the diseased and starving [[Inrithi]], found themselves incapable of slowing or stopping the First Holy War's general advance. Many attribute the Inrithi victory to the intercession of the [[God]], though a more likely explanation is to be found in the revelatory events preceding the battle. [[Nersei Proyas]] is particularly effective in his descriptions of the maniacal morale enjoyed by the Inrithi as a result of the Warrior-Prophet's Circumfixion and subsequent vindication. That the Kianene were overconfident is amply demonstrated by the Padirajah's decision to allow the First Holy War to assemble its ranks unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Battle of Caraskand'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurang.png|thumb|358x358px]]
'''Aurang''' was the last Prince of the [[Inchoroi]] and Horde-General to the [[No-God]] during the [[Apocalypse]]. He and his twin brother were the only Inchoroi who had survived to the present time. He was killed during the battle for [[Golgotterath]] during ''[[The Unholy Consult]]. ''

Very little is known of Aurang, save that he was one of the two original founders of the [[Consult]], and that he was the twin brother of [[Aurax]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Aurang’&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurang is only one of the many names he was known by. His own people named him '''Iskiak''', when he was the Spear-Bearer to [[Sil|Sil.]] The [[Nonmen]] of [[Ishterebinth]] called him by the title '''King-Healer''' or the name '''Sarpanur''', after the keystone that fixed their arches. After the epidemic of the [[Womb-Plague]], they cursed him as '''Sin-Pharion,''' “the Angel of Deceit.” Thousands of years later, the [[Norsirai]] of [[Kûniüri]] gave him the name '''Aurang,''' meaning “the Warlord.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
===''What Came Before''===
Aurang lived for uncounted millennia, and nothing is known of his background save that he was aboard the [[Incû-Holoinas]] and took part in the campaign where the Inchoroi attacked planet after planet and exterminated their native species down to 144,000 souls. He was one of the survivors when the great Ark crashed into [[Eärwa]].

Aurang fought in the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], where he served as Spear-Bearer to [[Sil]], the great King After-the-Fall. At one point, he rode into battle on the back of [[Wutteät]], the Father of [[Wracu|Dragons]]. During the battle of the [[Inniür-Shigogli]] plain where the Nonman King [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] was betrayed and killed, Aurang wrestled and defeated the great Nonman [[Ishroi]] hero, [[Ciögli|Ciögli the Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cûno-Inchoroi Wars, the steadily diminishing Inchoroi performed genetic experiments on themselves. Aurang and his brother Aurax, along with four others, were the only survivors of a genetic rewrite to give the Inchoroi the genetically-wired ability to perform [[sorcery]]. Eventually, the Nonmen won the war and exterminated the last Inchoroi, before sealing the Incû-Holoinas shut. Of their species, only Aurang and Aurax had survived.

Several thousands of years later, he was awoken in the depths of the Ark by the renegade sorcerer [[Shaeönanra]]. The two became lovers and founded the Consult together, to continue the ancient work of the Inchoroi and seal the world from the afterlife. Together, they ambushed and killed [[Titirga]] in 1119.

Aurang was one of the masterminds behind the Apocalypse, which began in the spring of 2143. He personally took part in several battles. Like the rest of the Consult’s leadership, he survived the No-God’s destruction.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
During the [[Holy War]], the Inchoroi gives directions to his agents, the [[skin-spies]], through a [[Synthese]]. He is able to overlook the war’s progress through this bio-engineered bird body. Aurang’s identity is revealed to the skin-spy [[Gaörta]] for the first time, and he states that he wants the Holy War to succeed and destroy the [[Cishaurim]]. The original reason behind the Holy War was to eliminate the Cishaurim, because of their unexplained ability to expose the Consult’s skin-spies.

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
Aurang communicates with [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] through the Synthese, granting him the service of several skin-spies in exchange for information on how to stop [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]. He has now learned that the Cishaurim were never the true threat to the Consult’s designs, but rather the mysterious [[Dûnyain]].

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
In his bird form, Aurang gives directions to the skin-spy [[Tsuör]], telling him to continue following the [[Skin Eaters]] and keep an eye on [[Nil’giccas]].

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
Aurang appears in his Inchoroi form at the [[Battle of Dagliash]], hovering above the battlefield.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
Aurang attacks Anasûrimbor Kellhus during the battle for Golgotterath, but the Aspect-Emperor defeats him and he is killed. &lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapter 17'' ''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aurax''' is a surviving Prince of the [[Inchoroi]].

Very little is known of Aurax, save that he is a ranking member of the [[Consult]] and the twin brother of [[Aurang]]. [[Mandate]] scholars speculate that it was he who first taught the [[Tekne]] science to the [[Mangaecca]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Aurax’&lt;/ref&gt;

He does not seem to have the vocal apparatus to speak, but instead communicates by using pheromones and telepathy.

==Story==
===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
An Inchoroi takes part in the Consult’s search for the mysterious [[Dûnyain]], capturing and torturing people for information. It is not clear whether this is Aurax or his twin brother, Aurang.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
During the battle for [[Golgotterath]], Aurax is seen bloated and wrecked, submissive to the new Consult formed out of Thought-Dancers within the [[Incû-Holoinas]] after his brother, [[Aurang]], is killed by [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]. It is unclear to whether he was killed or not.&lt;ref&gt;2. ''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapters 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The River Aumris is the cradle of [[Norsirai]] civilization. Over a relatively brief period of time, the High Norsirai tribes that settled the rich alluvial plains along the lower Aumris founded the first cities of [[Men]], including [[Trysë]], [[Sauglish]], [[Etrith]], [[Lokor]], and [[Ûmerau]]. As the result of trade with the [[Nonmen]] of [[Injor-Niyas]], the power and sophistication of the Aumris River civilization grew quickly, culminating in the [[Trysean Empire]] under the God-King [[Cûnwerishau]] in the fourth century.{{EG|Aumris River}}

The '''Battle of Kiyuth''' is an important battle between the Imperial Army of [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] and the [[Scylvendi]], fought in 4110 on the banks of the [[River Kiyuth]], a tributary of the [[River Sempis]].

[[Ikurei Conphas]], the Nansur Exalt-General, uses various tactics to goads the Scylvendi army into attacking immediately with all its strength. The overconfident Scylvendi King-of-Tribes [[Xunnurit]] orders the attack, believing that he can wipe out the Nansur army and return home before the droughts to drive his herds to summer pasture.

When the Scylvendi attack, it becomes clear that the Nansur army's banners have been rearranged to hide the fact that all of their best troops are in the center.

The elite Nansur troops reach and break the Scylvendi's [[chorae]]-archers. Once this is accomplished, sorcerers from the [[Imperial Saik]] appear and obliterate the now-defenseless Scylvendi host.

The Scylvendi defeat is unprecedented, given that it occurs on the [[Jiünati Steppe]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Battle of Kiyuth’&lt;/ref&gt; Conphas's success ensures that the Nansur Empire will not be attacked by the Scylvendi while the bulk of its army joins the [[Holy War]].

The '''Battle of Mehsarunath''' was the first great battle fought between the gathered might of [[Kyraneas]] and the host of the [[No-God]] on the [[Attong Plateau]] in 2154. Though [[Aurang]], the No-God's Horde-General, won the battle, the Kyranean High King, [[Anaxophus V]], was able to escape with much of his host intact, setting the stage for the far more decisive [[Second Battle of Mengedda]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Battle of Mehsarunath'&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mimara''' (sometimes referred to as '''Anasûrimbor Mimara''') is [[Esmenet]]'s first daughter and eldest child overall. Her father is unknown.
[[File:Miamrara.png|thumb|241x241px]]
She is one of the main protagonists of the [[Aspect-Emperor]] trilogy.

==Appearance==

Mimara is short and lithe, with black hair, green eyes and an acorn-shaped face&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;. She has a saddle of freckles over the bridge of her nose&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;. There is a very strong resemblance between Mimara and her mother, with the only clear differences being the former's differently-coloured eyes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, slightly longer jaw&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and paler skin&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;. Mimara initially has "half-cropped" hair&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, however, she later shaves her head so she'll resemble [[Nil'giccas]]'s dead wife&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;. By the time she and [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] reach [[Golgotterath]], her hair has grown back to a "cropped penitent short" state&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Personality==

Mimara is strong-willed. Spending much of her early life as a prostitute hardened her to physical abuse. According to [[Anasûrimbor Inrilatas|Inrilatas]], the only cruelty she cannot endure is kindness.

==Skills==

Mimara learned basic swordsmanship at the Imperial Palace. While she is one of [[the Few]], she has never used [[sorcery]], and thus has no [[Mark]] and can still handle [[Chorae]]. Mimara possesses a mystical ability called the [[Judging Eye]], which allows her to see the marks of good and evil deeds on people's souls, but it manifests only intermittently.

==Story==
===What Came Before===

Mimara was born to [[Esmenet]] while she was still a prostitute. Unable to support Mimara, and fearing she would die during a severe famine, Esmenet sold her to slavers, a decision she would regret for the rest of her life.

Mimara grew up as a child prostitute. She had a number of owners, at least one of whom she killed.

When Esmenet became the wife of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] and Empress of the Three Seas, she was distraught to discover that the half-[[Dûnyain]] children she bore Kellhus were incapable of loving her. She used her authority to dispatch soldiers in search of her precious firstborn, Mimara. They eventually found her in a brothel, dressed like her mother due to their resemblence. The soldiers burned the brothel and surrounding slum and brought Mimara to the palace. However, Mimara bore a deep resentment towards the mother who had abandoned her; and the conflict between the two was deliberately agitated by [[Kelmomas]], who resented Mimara as a competitor for Esmenet's affection. Mimara eventually fled the palace.

===''The Judging Eye''===

Mimara travels to see [[Drusas Achamian]], who Esmenet once told her was her father, and demands that he teach her sorcery. While Achamian initially refuses, she attempts to persuade him by a number of means, including seducing him.

When Achamian leaves his house to search for [[Ishuäl]] in the company of the [[Skin Eaters]], Mimara secretly follows him. The Skin Eaters quickly discover her, and she joins the group.

In the depths of the Black Halls of [[Cil-Aujas]], Mimara looks at a Chorae with her Judging Eye, and it appears to change from a point of darkness to a point of light. She is subsequently able to use the altered Chorae to exorcise the spirit of [[Gin'yursis]], the Wight-in-the-Mountain.

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===

Mimara, Achamian, and the remaining Skin Eaters continue their journey towards [[Sauglish]], where a map to Ishuäl can be found. Mimara discovers that their group contains a [[skin-spy]], [[Tsuör]]; however, because it seems intent on assisting them in reaching their destination, she keeps it secret from Achamian. Tsuör tells Mimara that she is pregnant with Achamian's child, and that Nil'giccas plans to kill her when they reach Sauglish.

During the journey, Mimara becomes addicted to the [[Nonman]] drug [[Qirri]], as do all of her companions.

When the group reaches the [[Library of Sauglish]], infighting erupts, and Mimara, Achamian, and [[Sarl]] are left as the only survivors. Obtaining the map to Ishuäl, Mimara and Achamian leave Sarl behind and continue onwards by themselves. After fighting their way past hordes of [[Sranc]], Mimara and Achamian finally reach Ishuäl, only to find it in ruins.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===

===''The Unholy Consult''===

== Trivia ==
When Mimara first appears in the series, her eyes are noted as being green&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, but in ''[[The Unholy Consult]] ''she is said to have brown eyes&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

Even without training, the Few are able to see the [[Mark]], allowing them to distinguish sorcery from the natural world; hence the oft-repeated phrase, “Only the Few can see the Few.”{{EG|“Only the Few can see the Few”}} However, until actually using sorcery themselves, they bear no Mark and can handle [[Chorae]] without harm.

One way to distinguish the Few from common Men without Marking them is through a [[Wathi Doll]], by having the person speak aloud the artifact's cipher. If the person is of the Few the doll will awaken, however the person will not develop a Mark and should still be able to handle Chorae.{{2|10}}

Those of the Few who receive training are classified as [[Qûya]], [[Shaman]]s, [[Sorcerer]]s, [[Witch]]es, or [[Wizard]]s, depending on such factors as race, gender, and whether or not they belong to a [[The Schools|School]].

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1188">The '''Thousand Temples''' are the ecclesiastical and administrative framework of [[Inrithism]], based in [[Sumna]] but omnipresent throughout most of the [[Three Seas]].

The Thousand Temples first became a dominant social and political institution during the reign of the first Aspect-Emperor, [[Triamis the Great]], who declared Inrithism the official faith of the [[Ceneian Empire]] in 2505. Authority is nominally centralized in the person of the [[Shriah]], who is regarded as the [[Inri Sejenus|Latter Prophet]]'s living representative, but the sheer size and complexity of the Thousand Temples often renders that authority ceremonial. Aside from the management of the temples proper, there are the ecclesiastical courts, the political missions, the various Colleges, and the labyrinthine interconnections with the [[Cults]] to administer. As a result, the Thousand Temples often suffers from weak leadership, and is regarded with cynicism by many in the Three Seas.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Thousand Temples'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">The '''Ceneian Empire''' was the greatest [[Ketyai]] empire in history, embracing the entirety of the [[Three Seas]] at its greatest extent, from the [[Atkondras Mountains]] in the southwest, to [[Huösi|Lake Huösi]] in the north, to the [[Great Kayarsus|Great Kayarsus Mountains]] in the southeast. The primary agent in the creation and maintenance of this empire was the Ceneian Imperial Army, which was perhaps the best trained and organized in history.

No more than a minor river trading town in the days of [[Kyraneas]], [[Cenei]] emerged from the [[Age of Warring Cities]] as the pre-eminent city of the [[Kyranae Plains]]. The conquest of [[Gielgath]] in 2349 sealed the city’s regional dominance, and in the ensuing decades the Ceneians under [[Xercallas II]] would secure the remnants of what had once been Kyraneas. Xercallas’s successors continued his aggressive, expansionist policies, first pacifying the [[Norsirai]] tribes of [[Cepalor]], then waging three consecutive wars against [[Shigek]], which fell in 2397. Then, in 2414, after conquering [[Enathpaneah]], [[Xerash]], and [[Amoteu]], General [[Naxentas]] staged a successful coup and declared himself Emperor of Cenei. Though he would be assassinated the following year, all his successors would avail themselves of the Imperial institutions he created.

[[Triamis the Great]] became Emperor in 2478, beginning what most scholars consider the [[Age of Cenei|Ceneian Golden Age]]. In 2483 he conquered [[Nilnamesh]], and then [[Cingulat]] the following year. In 2485, he defeated a great [[Zeüm]]i host at [[Amarah]], and would have invaded the [[Satyothi]] nation had no mutinies among his homesick troops prevented him. He spent the next decade consolidating his gains, and striving against the internecine religious violence between followers of the traditional [[Kiünnat]] sects and the growing numbers of [[Inrithism|Inrithi]]. It was in the course of negotiating settlements that he became friends with the then [[Shriah]] of the [[Thousand Temples]], [[Ekyannus III]], and in 2505 he himself converted to Inrithism, declaring it the official state religion of the Ceneian Empire. He spent the next ten years putting down religious rebellions, while at the same time invading and occupying both [[Cironj]] (2508) and [[Nron]] (2511). He then spent ten years campaigning across the eastern Three Seas against the successor nations of the old [[Shiradi Empire]], first conquering [[High Ainon|Ainon]] (2518), then [[Cengemis]] (2519), and finally [[Annand]] (2525).

Ensuing Aspect-Emperors would marginally add to the extent of the empire, but its boundaries remained fairly stable for nearly eight hundred years, during which time the language and institutions of Imperial Cenei and the Thousand Temples would be stitched into the very fabric of Three Seas society. Aside from periodic wars with Zeüm, and the interminable wars against the [[Scylvendi]] and Norsirai tribes across the empire’s northern frontier, this would be an age of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and commerce. Only the periodic civil wars, usually fought over succession, posed any real threat to the empire.

Though Cenei itself was destroyed by the Scylvendi under [[Horiötha]] in 3351, historians traditionally date the collapse of the Ceneian Empire in 3372, when General [[Maurelta]] surrendered to [[Sarothesser I]] in Ainon.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ceneian Empire’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inri Sejenus''' is the Latter Prophet and spiritual (although not historical) founder of the [[Thousand Temples]].

Inri Sejenus claimed to be the pure incarnation of Absolute Spirit (“the very proportion of the God”), sent to amend the teachings of the [[Tusk]]. After his death and supposed ascension to the [[Nail of Heaven]], his disciples recounted his life and teachings in ''[[The Tractate]]'', the text that is now considered by the [[Inrithi]] to be as holy as ''The Chronicle of the Tusk''.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Inri Sejenus’&lt;/ref&gt;

Trivia: The acronym '''INRI''' (''Iēsus Nazarēnus, Rēx Iūdaeōrum'') represents the Latin inscription which in English reads as “Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus,_King_of_the_Jews Jesus, King of the Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3340">[[File:Nansur_Empire.png|thumb|400px|The Nansur Empire in 4109.]]The '''Nansur Empire''' was a nation of the [[Three Seas]] and self-proclaimed inheritor to the [[Ceneian Empire]]. At the height of its power the Nansur Empire extended from [[Galeoth]] to [[Nilnamesh]], but it was much reduced by centuries of warfare against the [[Fanim]] [[Kian]]ene.

Though the Nansur Empire had witnessed its fair share of usurpers, palace revolts, and short-lived military dictatorships, it had enjoyed a remarkable degree of dynastic stability. It was under the Trimus Emperors (3411-3508) that the "Nansur" (the traditional name for the district surrounding [[Momemn]]) emerged from the chaos following [[Cenei]]'s destruction to unify that [[Kyranae Plains]]. But true Imperial expansion did not occur until the Zerxei Dynasty (3511-3619), which, under the rule of successive and short-lived Emperors, managed to conquer [[Shigek]] (3539), [[Enathpaneah]] (3569), and the Sacred Lands of [[Xerash]] and [[Amoteu]] (3574).

Under the Surmante Emperors (3619-3941), the Nansurium enjoyed its greatest period of growth and military ascendancy, culminating in the rule of [[Surmante Xatantius I]] (3644-3693), who subdued the [[Cepalor]]an tribes as far north as the [[River Vindauga]], and who even managed to capture the ancient Nilnameshi capital of [[Invishi]], thus very nearly restoring all the so-called Western Empire that had once belonged to Cenei. But his practice of debasing the talent in order to finance his endless wars fairly wrecked the empire's economy. By the time [[Fan'oukarji I]] embarked on his [[White Jihad]] in 3743, the empire still had not recovered from Xatantius's excesses. His Surmante descendents found themselves embroiled in never-ending wars they could ill afford, let alone win. Scarce resources and an intransigent commitment to the Ceneian model of warfare, which seemed incapable of coping with Kianene tactics, conspired to render the empire's decline an inevitability.

The dynasty of the most recent claimants to the Imperial Mantle, the Ikurei, arose as the result of a coup brought about by the turmoil following the loss of [[Shigek]] to the Kianene in 3933 (in the so-called [[Dagger Jihad]] of [[Fan'oukarji III]]). A former Exalt-General, [[Ikurei Sorius I]] reorganized both the Imperial Army and the empire, changes that allowed him and his descendants to defeat no fewer than three full-scale Fanim invasions. The Nansur Empire had enjoyed a precarious stability ever since, though it remained continually fearful of the prospect tht the [[Scylvendi]] tribes might unite once again&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 469, 'Nansur Empire'&lt;/ref&gt;. It was conquered by [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] during the [[Unification Wars|unification wars]] of the [[New Empire]] shortly after 4112 and the fall of [[Shimeh]].&lt;ref&gt;The White Luck Warrior, maps&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mark''' is the name for what is otherwise known as the “bruising of the [[onta]].” Aside from the [[Psûkhe]], which may or may not be a true [[sorcery]], all sorcerous manifestations and practitioners exhibit what is called the Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Mark, the’&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Few|Few]] can see the Mark on anyone who has used sorcery and on anything that has been altered through sorcerous means.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Few, the’&lt;/ref&gt;

Various descriptions of the Mark have come down through history, but there seems to be little consistency in the accounts, apart from the experience’s ephemeral nature.

According to religious accounts, the Mark is akin to the disfiguring of criminals, the way the [[God of Gods|God]] reveals the blasphemers in the presence of the righteous. But apologists such as [[Zarathinius]] point out that if this is indeed the case, then it is more than a little ironic that only the ''blasphemers'' can see the Mark.

In secular accounts, textual analogies are typically resorted to: seeing the Mark is akin to seeing where text has been scratched away and overwritten in ancient documents. In the case of sorcery, since the amendments to reality are as flawed as the [[Men]] who do the amending, it stands to reason that some essential difference would be visible.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Mark, the’&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Anasûrimbor Moënghus''' is a [[Cishaurim]] Priest and former [[Dûnyain]] monk. He is the father of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] and the main instigator of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]].

==Appearance==
Moënghus has white skin and blonde hair. He once had blue eyes, but by the time of his appearance in ''[[The Thousandfold Thought (Book)|The Thousandfold Thought]]'' they have been put out and he has empty sockets.{{3|15}}

He bears scars on his arms, which he himself carved so as to disguise himself as a [[Scylvendi]] while crossing the [[Jiünati Steppe]].{{1|12}}

==Personality==
As a Dûnyain, Moënghus is entirely devoted to the pure logic and reason of the [[Logos]], and so lacks any traits that might be considered as a personality.

==Skills==
Like all Dûnyain, Moënghus has speed, strength, stamina, and intelligence superior to a normal human. He is capable of effortlessly reading and manipulating the emotions of world-born [[Men]], and can use the probability trance to see all possible outcomes of his actions and so find the Shortest Way.

Moënghus blinded himself to became a Cishaurim and gain the powers of the [[Psûkhe]]. However, because the Psûkhe is based on the passions which the Dûnyain have long bred themselves to eliminate, Moënghus’s abilities are far inferior to those of other Cishaurim. Most notable among his limited powers is the ability to send messages through dreams using the [[Cants of Calling]].

Though Moënghus’s Dûnyain abilities were lessened by his blinding, he is still able to identify [[skin-spies]] based on discrepancies in their voices.{{3|16}}

==Story==
===What Came Before===
Like all Dûnyain, Moënghus was born and raised in the fortress of [[Ishuäl]]. In the year 4079, Ishuäl was discovered by a band of [[Sranc]]. Moënghus was sent out into the world to determine the degree to which their secrecy had been compromised. Afterwards, it was decided that he had been too contaminated by the external world to return, and was exiled to die.{{1|12}}

However, Moënghus survived. He was captured by the [[Utemot]] and given to the mother of Scylvendi [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] as a slave, but used his skill at manipulation to survive. He seduced Cnaiür’s mother, convinced Cnaiür to kill his father, and disguised himself as a Scylvendi to cross the Jiünati Steppe. Afterwards, he headed south, into [[Fanimry|Fanim]] lands.

Once more sold into slavery by the Fanim, Moënghus used the same tactics to rise to a position of power. He travelled to [[Shimeh]] to learn the Psûkhe from the Cishaurim, believing he would master it quickly and gain god-like power. However, because of his lack of passion, he ended up blind with very little power in compensation.

In 4100, Moënghus discovered a [[Consult]] skin-spy. After years of experimentation, he was able to find a method to effectively torture the creatures using [[neuropuncture]], and learned of the Consult’s plans to bring about the [[Second Apocalypse]].

Though determined to prevent the Second Apocalypse, Moënghus lacked the power to oppose the Consult on his own. So he used one of the few aspects of the Psûkhe he could master, the Cants of Calling, to send sorcerous dreams to Ishuäl and ask that his son Anasûrimbor Kellhus be sent to him. He then instigated the [[Holy War]] so that Kellhus would have a means of passage to Shimeh.{{3|16}}

Moënghus had a number of children by world-born women during this time; however, he killed most of them when they demonstrated the defects that commonly result from human-Dûnyain interbreeding. Only [[Maithanet]] was allowed to live.{{5|8}}

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Moënghus meets with [[Ikurei Xerius III]] under the assumed name of Mallahet, and uses sorcery to allow the Emperor to speak with [[Skauras ab Nalajan]].

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
Kellhus meets Moënghus in an ancient [[Nonmen|Nonman]] Mansion beneath [[Kyudea]]. Moënghus explains how he called for Kellhus and orchestrated the Holy War to place a Dûnyain in the position of being able to oppose the resurrection of the [[No-God]]; however, now that Kellhus is before him, he believes his son has become deranged from his contact with the outside world. Kellhus stabs Moënghus and teleports away. Cnaiür then arrives, having followed Kellhus. The two speak; then Cnaiür kills Moënghus with a [[Chorae]].

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">[[File:Kian.png|thumb|400px|Kian in 4109.]]'''Kian''' is the most powerful nation of the [[Three Seas]], extending from the southern frontier of the [[Nansur Empire]] to [[Nilnamesh]].

The Kianene were originally a desert people from the fringes of the [[Great Salt]]. Various [[Ceneian]] and Nilnameshi sources refer to them as cunning and audacious raiders, the target of several different campaigns and punitive expeditions. In his monumental ''[[The Annals of Cenei]]'', [[Casidas]] describes them as "courtly savages, at once disarmingly gracious and murderous in the extreme". Despite their reputation and apparent numbers (Nansur records indicate several attempts to gauge their numbers by concerned provincial governors), the Kianene spent most of their time battle amongst themselves over scarce desert resources. Their conversion to [[Fanimry]] (c. 3704-3724) would change this, and with drastic consequences.

Following the unification of the Kianene tribes under [[Fane]], [[Fan'oukarji I]], Fane's eldest son and the first of Kian's Padirajahs, led his countrymen in the so-called [[White Jihad]], winning a series of spectacular victories over the Nansur Imperial Army. By the time of his death in 3771, Fan'oukarji I had conquered all of [[Mongilea]] and had made serious inroads into [[Eumarna]]. He had also founded his capital, [[Nenciphon]], on the banks of the [[River Sweki]].

Successive Jihads would see Eumarna (3801), [[Enathpaneah]] (3842), [[Xerash]] and [[Amoteu]] (3845), then finally [[Shigek]] and [[Gedea]] (3933) all fall to Kian. Though the Nilnameshi would successfully thwart several different Kianene invasions, Fanic missionaries would succeed in converting the [[Girgash]]i to Fanimry in the thirty-eighth century. By the end of the fourth millennium Kian was easily the pre-eminent military and commercial power of the Three Seas, and a source of endless consternation not only for the much-diminished Nansur Empire but for [[Inrithi]] Princes in every nation&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 458, 'Kian'&lt;/ref&gt;.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2480">'''Kûniüri''' is a lost nation of the [[Ancient North]] and the last of the ancient Aumris empires.

High [[Norsirai]] city-states developed along the [[River Aumris]] and from ''c.'' 300 were united under [[Cûnwerishau]], the God-King of [[Trysë]]. From ''c.'' 500 the city of [[Ûmerau]] gained ascendancy, leading to the [[Ûmeri Empire|Ûmerau Empire]] and the cultural efflorescence of the [[Nonman Tutelage]] under [[Carû-Ongonean]]. Ancient Ûmeria thrived until defeated by the [[Cond]] tribesmen of [[Aulyanau|Aulyanau the Conqueror]] in 917. The rapid collapse of the so-called Cond Yoke led to a second period of Trysean dominance of the Aumris, this one lasting until 1228, when another series of White Norsirai migratory invasions resulted in the so-called Scintya Yoke.

The Kûniüric period proper did not begin until 1408, when [[Anasûrimbor Nanor-Ukkerja I]], exploiting the confusion surrounding the collapse of the Scintya Empire, seized the Ur-Throne in Trysë, declaring himself the first High King of Kûniüri. Over the course of his long life (he lived to the age of 178, the reputed result of the Nonman blood in his veins), Nanor-Ukkerja I extended Kûniüri to the [[Yimaleti Mountains]] in the north, to the westernmost coasts of the [[Cerish|Cerish Sea]] in the east, to [[Sakarpus]] in the south, and to the [[Demua Mountains]] in the west. At his death, he divided this empire between his sons, creating [[Aörsi]] and [[Sheneor]] in addition to Kûniüri proper.

Kûniüri became, largely by virtue of its cultural inheritance, the centre of learning and craft for all [[Eärwa]]. The Trysean court hosted what were called the Thousand Sons, the scions of Kings from lands as far away as ancient [[Shigek]] and [[Shir]]. The holy city of [[Sauglish]] hosted pilgrim scholars from as far away as [[Zeüm|Angka]] and [[Nilnamesh]]. High Norsirai fashions were emulated throughout Eärwa.

This golden age came to an end with the [[Apocalypse]] and the defeat and death of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]] on the [[Fields of Eleneöt]] during the [[Battle of Eleneöt Fields]] in 2146. All the ancient cities of the Aumris would be destroyed the following year. The surviving Kûniüri were either enslaved or scattered.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kûniüri’&lt;/ref&gt;

They are a dark-haired, light-eyed, and fair-skinned race of nomads who are predominantly concentrated on and around the [[Jiünati Steppe]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 483, 'Scylvendi'&lt;/ref&gt;. They speak the Skaaric language.

==Leadership==

The Scylvendi are divided into a number of independent tribes, each with its own Chieftain. Only when the tribes gather for war against non-Scylvendi outsiders will the tribal leaders elect an overall monarch, a King-of-Tribes, and only for the duration of the conflict.

==Culture==

The Scylvendi are cattle-herders, and sustain themselves from their cattle which they move around the steppe with the seasons for grazing. As mounted nomads who despise the farmers and city-dwellers, they regard themselves as the "People of War".

==Religion==

During the [[Apocalypse]], the Scylvendi fought on the side of the [[No-God]]. They continue to worship it under the name Lokung ("Dead-God")&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 463, 'Lokung'&lt;/ref&gt;. The Scylvendi believe that the other nations of the Three Seas bear the blood-guilt of deicide, and perpetually fight wars against them to avenge their god&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 12, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Mengedda.jpg|thumb|300px|At the urging of Seswatha, founder of the School of Mandate, Anaxophus V, High King of Kyraneas, wields the Heron Spear against the No-God at Mengedda, thus ending the First Apocalypse.]]

'''Seswatha''' was the founder of the School of [[Mandate]] and an implacable enemy of the [[Consult]] throughout the [[Apocalypse]].

Born the [[caste]]-menial son of a [[Tryse]]an bronzesmith, Seswatha was identified as one of [[the Few]] at a very young age and brought to [[Sauglish]] to study with the [[Gnostic]] [[School]] of [[Sohonc]]. A prodigy, he became the youngest [[sorcerer]] of rank in the history of the Sohonc at the age of fifteen. During this time he became fast friends with [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], a so-called "Hostage of the Sohonc", as the School referred to its resident exoteric students. As this strategic friendship might suggest, Seswatha proved an adroit political operator, both before becoming Grandmaster and after, forging relationships with important personages across the Three Seas, including [[Nil'giccas]], the [[Nonman]] King of [[Ishterebinth]], and [[Anaxophus V]], who would become the High King of [[Kyraneas]]. These skills, in addition to his peerless command of the Gnosis, would make him the natural, if not the titular, leader of the various wars waged against the Consult before the Apocalypse. He and Celmomas would become estranged during this time, apparently because Celmomas resented Seswatha's influence over his youngest son, [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]], but legends have long circulated that Nau-Cayûti was in fact Seswatha's son, the product of an illicit union between him and [[Sharal]], the most prized of Celmomas's wives. They would not be reconciled until the eve of the Apocalypse -- after it was far too late.{{EG|Seswatha}}

Seswatha's mummified heart remains in possession of the School of Mandate, and is used in the Grasping, a rite which grants all Mandate sorcerers [[Seswatha's Dreams]].{{EG|Seswatha's Heart}}

The [[Sranc]] called Seswatha by the name "Chigra", meaning "Slaying Light"; a term which is still in use by [[skin-spies]] to refer to Mandate sorcerers.{{EG|Chigra}}

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1506">The '''Norsirai''' are the second largest of the [[Five Tribes of Men]]. They are typically a tall, blond-haired, blue-eyed race predominantly concentrated along the northern fringes of the [[Three Seas]], although they once dominated the continent of [[Eärwa]] and ruled all the lands northward to the [[Yimaleti Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Norsirai’&lt;/ref&gt; The Norsirai were once the most powerful race of [[Men]], but after the disasters of the [[Apocalypse]], they have been vastly diminished in power and numbers. They are traditionally divided into the High Norsirai and White Norsirai; the former were tutored by the [[Nonmen]] and founded urban civilizations of [[Ancient North]], while the latter remained wilder and nomadic for a longer time. The ancient empires of the High Norsirai were all destroyed in the Apocalypse; the contemporary Norsirai nations all descend from the White Norsirai. They speak tongues belonging to the language group Vasnosri.

Achamian states that Norsirai are tall because they eat more red meat than the other tribes of man.

Primarily for geographical reasons, the fertile plains to the south of the [[Hinayati Mountains]] have long enjoyed cultural and political independence from the Three Seas. [[Casidas]] was the first to remark that the Nilnameshi were an "inward people", both in the sense of their obsession with the plight of their souls and in their utter disdain for outland Princes. Only two periods in their history cut against this tendency. The first is the Old Invishi period (1023-1572), when Nilnamesh was united under a series of aggressively expansionist Kings based in [[Invishi]], which is now the traditional spiritual capital of Nilnamesh. In 1322 and then again in 1326, [[Anzumarapata II]] inflicted crushing defeats on the [[Shigek]]i, and for some thirty years compelled tribute from the proud river kingdom. Then, in 2483, [[Sarnagiri V]], leading a coalition of Princes, was routed by [[Triamis the Great]], and Nilnamesh found itself a province (albeit an unruly one) for more than a thousand years.

The era following the collapse of the [[Ceneian Empire]] is commonly called the New Invishi period, though none of the ancient city's Kings has been able to hold more than a fraction of Nilnamesh for more than a generation&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 471, 'Nilnamesh'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nilnamesh is currently the home of the world's largest Anagogic School, the [[Vokalati]].

Great cities (of which only [[Iothiah]] survives) and monumental works, including the famed Ziggurats, were raised along the River Sempis&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Then, in 1951, the God-King [[Mithoser II]] was decisively defeated by the Kyraneans at [[Narakit]], and Shigek began its long tenure as a tributary to greater powers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

[[File:Mengedda.jpg|thumb|300px|At the urging of Seswatha, founder of the School of Mandate, Anaxophus V, High King of Kyraneas, wields the Heron Spear against the No-God at Mengedda, thus ending the First Apocalypse.]]

'''Anaxophus V''' was the [[Kyraneas|Kyranean]] ruler during the dark years of the [[Apocalypse]]. He famously killed the [[No-God]] with the [[Heron Spear]] in 2155, so winning the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]] and finally ending the nightmare of the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Anaxophus V’&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaxophus had recovered the Heron Spear after the disastrous [[Battle of Eleneöt Fields]] and hidden it away. Some historians, [[Casidas]] among them, have called this the most monstrous deception in history. How could Anaxophus conceal the only weapon that could defeat the No-God while the greater part of the world died? But others, including many belonging to the [[Mandate]], argued precisely the opposite. They admitted that Anaxophus’s motive—to save Kyraneas and Kyraneas alone—was more than a little suspect. But they pointed to the fact that had he not hidden the Heron Spear, it would surely have been lost in the catastrophes following the defeat at Eleneöt.

Anaxophus was a close friend of the sorcerer [[Seswatha]], who called him “Anakka.”

==Summary==
{{Blockquote|If it is only after that we understand what has come before, then we understand nothing. Thus we shall define the soul as follows: that which precedes everything.|[[Ajencis]], [[The Third Analytic of Men]]}}

'''2147 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], the [[Demua Mountains|Mountains of Demua]]'''

In [[Ishuäl]], the secret refuge of the [[Kûniüri]]c High Kings, [[Anasûrimbor Ganrelka II]]’s household is wiped out by a plague save for Ganrelka’s bastard son and a Bardic Priest. The Priest molests the boy muttering “There are no crimes when no one is left alive.” The Priest is then killed by the boy.

Later, a group of [[Dûnyain]] refugees seems to stumbles upon Ishuäl and scales its walls. One of them finds the boy and asks why he fears them, to which the boy replies, “So long as men live, there are crimes!” and the man says “No, child, only so long as men are deceived.”

The Dûnyain and boy find shelter in Ishuäl against the [[Apocalypse]], and the world forgets them for two thousand years.

'''Late Autumn, 4109 Year-of-the-Tusk, the Mountains of Demua'''

1962 years later, the Dûnyain are sent dreams by someone demanding that they send to him his son. They meet in the Labyrinth called the [[Thousand Thousand Halls]] where they decide that this “desecration” cannot be tolerated.

[[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], the son in question, sets out of Ishuäl to find his father, while the “dreamers” descend to the Thousand Thousand Halls where they will die.

Kellhus wanders around until he is too weak to continue and succumbs. A trapper named [[Leweth]] finds him buried in snow and saves him. Kellhus possesses the man’s thoughts using his much superior intellect and the fact that he can read his thoughts through his face. Leweth tells Kellhus about the [[No-God]], the [[Consult]], [[Sorcery]], the [[Gods]], and the [[Apocalypse]], all of which Kellhus dismisses as superstition.

Eventually, Leweth and Kellhus are attacked by a band of [[Sranc]] and are forced to leave their cabin. Leweth is wounded and tells Kellhus about the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] Ruins to the west. Kellhus leaves him for the Sranc.

Kellhus moves on and encounters a deranged Nonman [[Qûya]].&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Although this Nonman is not named, Bakker revealed outside of the text that it is [[Cet’ingira]], or Mekeritrig.&lt;/ref&gt; The two fight and Kellhus is stunned by the Nonman’s use of sorcery. He flees while the Nonman’s booming voice says “I WILL REMEMBER.”

'''Anasûrimbor Celmomas II''' was the leader of the coalition against [[Golgotterath]] in the early days of the [[Apocalypse]], and the last and greatest of the [[Kûniüri]]c High Kings.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Celmomas II, Anasûrimbor’&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a close friend of the sorcerer [[Seswatha]], who often acted as his advisor. Celmomas was married to [[Suriala]], and among his sons were [[Anasûrimbor Ganrelka II]] and the famous war hero [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]]. But perhaps Nau-Cayûti was in truth the bastard son of Suriala and Seswatha.

In the Apocalypse’s early years, Celmomas was fatally wounded in battle by a [[Sranc]] chieftain during the [[Battle of Eleneöt Fields]]. With his dying words, he prophesied to Seswatha that a descendant of his would return at the end of the world. While few in the [[Three Seas]] believe the [[Celmomian Prophecy]], as it is known, most [[Mandate]] scholars think it authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Celmomian Prophecy’&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Drusas Achamian]] believes that the prophecy refers to [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].

Celmomas wielded a large ensorcelled sword named Glimir, which was said to pass through foes with great ease. &lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">The '''Library of Sauglish''' is a famed temple complex and text repository found in ancient [[Sauglish]].

The archive was founded by [[Carû-Ongonean]], the third [[Ûmeri Empire|Ûmeri]] God-King, c. 560, and transformed by [[Nincaerû-Telesser II]] (574-668) into the cultural heart of the [[Ancient North]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Great Library of Sauglish’&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, the Library had grown to the size of a city within the city by the time of Sauglish’s destruction during the [[Apocalypse]] in 2147.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Library of Sauglish’&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Wracu]] [[Wutteät]] took up residence in the Library at some point after its destruction. He resided in the [[Coffers]] until being driven away by [[Drusas Achamian]] and [[Nil’giccas]] in 4132.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triamis the Great''' was the first [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] of the [[Ceneian Empire]], famed for his conquests and for declaring [[Inrithism]] the official state religion in 2505.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Triamis the Great'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==

Triamis the Great became Emperor in 2478, beginning what most scholars consider the Ceneian Golden Age. In 2483 he conquered [[Nilnamesh]], and then [[Cingulat]] the following year. In 2485, he defeated a great [[Zeüm]]i host at [[Amarah]], and would have invaded the [[Satyothi]] nation had not mutinies among his homesick troops prevented him. He spent the next decade consolidating his gains, and striving against the internecine religious violence between followers of the traditional Kiünnat sects and the growing numbers of Inrithi. It was in the course of negotiating settlements that he became friends with the then Shriah of the [[Thousand Temples]], [[Ekyannus III]], and in 2505 he himself converted to Inrithism, declaring it the official state religion of the Ceneian Empire. He spent the next ten years putting down religious rebellions, while at the same time invading and occupying both [[Cironj]] (2508) and [[Nron]] (2511). He then spent ten years campaigning across the eastern Three Seas against the successor nations of the old [[Shiradi Empire]], first conquering [[Ainon]] (2518), then [[Cengemis]] (2519), and finally [[Annand]] (2525).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Ceneian Empire'&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 2577 at the age of 121.

==Works==

Triamis the Great's collected works and writings have been published as ''[[Journals and Dialogues]].''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Journals and Dialogues'&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gnosis''' is a branch of [[sorcery]] once practiced by the Gnostic [[The Schools|School]]s of the [[Ancient North]].

Gnostic sorcery is based on logic—it is leveraged through the use of the Abstractions, which is why Gnostic [[sorcerer]]s are often referred to as Philosopher Magi. The Gnosis is the most powerful of all sorceries in the world, as it is an expression of pure logic. Unlike the [[Anagogis|Anagogic]] sorcery, which merely uses figurative Analogies, the Gnosis summons the meaning itself.

Skill in the Gnosis relies on intellect and purity of meaning, while the Anagogis relies on creative metaphors and the [[Psûkhe]] relies on raw emotion. Gnostic sorcery usually takes the form of geometric shapes.

The Gnosis was first developed by the [[Nonmen]] [[Qûya]], who taught it to the early [[Norsirai]] Anagogic sorcerers during the period of cultural exchange known as the [[Nonman Tutelage]], 555-825.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Gnosis’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
The Gnosis was originally practiced by four Schools, including the [[Mangaecca]], the [[Mihtrûl]], and the [[Sohonc]]. However, the Mangaecca was outlawed in 1123, and the other three schools were destroyed in the [[Apocalypse]].

For two thousand years, the only groups which practiced the Gnosis were the remnants of the Mangaecca, now known as the [[Consult]], and the School of [[Mandate]], a School founded by [[Seswatha]], the last Grandmaster of Sohonc, to prevent a [[Second Apocalypse]]. Many attempts were made by the Anagogic Schools to steal the Gnosis from the Mandate, but one of the effects of [[Seswatha’s Dreams]], which all members of the Mandate inherited, was to render them immune to torture.

After becoming Aspect-Emperor, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] established a new Gnostic School, the [[Swayal Compact]], which was also the first School for [[witch]]es.

==Trivia==
* The branches of sorcery all take their names from Greek words. “Gnosis” comes from the Greek word “Γνώσης,” meaning “Knowledge.”

A derivative of the more esoteric ''mirqu'' played by [[Nonmen]], the first extant references to benjuka date back to the so-called [[Nonman Tutelage]] (555-825).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘benjuka’&lt;/ref&gt;

The cunning of benjuka lies in the absence of a fixed framework. Rather than providing an immutable ground, the rules of benjuka are yet another move ''within'' the game, yet another piece to be played. This makes benjuka the very image of life, a game of baffling complexities and near poetic subtleties.

The complexities of benjuka are such that a player can never intellectually master the plate and so ''force'' another to yield. Benjuka is like love. One can never force another to love. The more one graspes for it, the more elusives it became. Benjuka punishes a grasping heart. Where other games require industrious cunning, benjuka demands something more. Wisdom, perhaps.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wizard''' is the name given to man who practise [[sorcery]] independent of any [[the Schools|School]], despite their persecution by both the [[Thousand Temples]] and the Schools.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘wizards’&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schools hunt down and kill any known wizards so as to maintain their monopoly on the secrets of magic; therefore, wizards are extremely rare. In the year 4131, the only known wizard in the [[Three Seas]] is [[Drusas Achamian]]. While [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] also is a practitioner of sorcery who belongs to no School, he is believed to be a prophet of the [[God of Gods|God]] and so is instead classified as a [[Shaman]].

A sorcerer who is skillful enough to teach sorcery to another is generally given the title "sorcerer of rank", though practices vary between Schools&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 489, 'sorcerer of rank'&lt;/ref&gt;.

All sorcerers save the [[Cishaurim]] bear the [[Mark]], and all are turned to salt by the touch of [[Chorae]].

At some point this primitives were conquered by Nonmen and further existed as slaves to them. They delved the deep mines and tilled the fields for their long-lived masters. The sole exception was in the uttermost north, where the [[Nonmen|Cûnuroi]] of [[Viri]] instead ''employed'' men and treated them with more respect, to the derision of their peers.

At some point the [[Inchoroi]] tried to turn them against their Nonmen masters and gave them [[Chorae]] to help them do so.  The Emwama did not desire to rebel however, and instead gave the Chorae to their Nonmen masters.  With this the Inchoroi turned their efforts to the tribes of men from [[Eänna]].

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2134">The '''Shiradi Empire''' was the first great nation to arise in the eastern Three Seas, where it ruled much of what is now [[Cengemis]], [[Conriya]], and [[High Ainon]] for much of [[Far Antiquity]].

By c. 500 a number of [[Hamori]] [[Ketyai]] tribes had settled the length of the [[River Sayut]] and the [[Secharib Plains]], becoming more sedentary and socially stratified as they exploited the rich cereal yields afforded by the fertile soils of the region. But unlike [[Shigek]], where the first God-Kings were able to unify the [[River Sempis|Sempis River]] Valley quite early, Seto-Annaria, as it came to be called (after the two most dominant tribes), remained a collection of warring city-states. Eventually the balance of power shifted to the north, to the city-state of [[Shir]] on the [[River Maurat]], and sometime in the thirteenth century it managed to subdue all the cities of Seto-Annaria, though its rulers would spend generations putting down rebellions (the Seto-Annarians apparently thought themselves superior to their uncouth cousins from the north). Then, sometime in the fifteenth century, [[Xiuhianni]] invaders from [[Jekhia|Jekk]] ravaged the empire and Shir was razed to the ground. The survivors moved the capital to ancient [[Aöknyssus]] (the present administrative capital of [[Conriya]]) and after some twenty years managed to oust the [[Eännean]] invaders. Centuries of stability followed, until 2153, when the forces of the [[No-God]] inflicted a disastrous defeat on the Shiradi at the [[Battle of Nurubal]]. The following two hundred years of chaos and internecine warfare effectively destroyed what remained of the empire and its central institutions.

The influence of ancient Shir is evident in many respects in the eastern Ketyai nations of the Three Seas, from the revering of beards (first cultivated by [[caste]]-nobles to distinguish themselves from the Xiuhianni, who were reputed to be unable to grow beards) to the continued use of a Shiradi-derived pictographic script in High Ainon.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Shiradi Empire'&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the four successor nations to the [[Shiradi Empire]] ([[Cengemis]], Conriya, Ainon, and [[Sansor]]), none has worked so hard to reclaim and preserve its ancient traditions. Nowhere are the [[caste]] divisions more rigidly observed, and nowhere are the codes governing caste-noble behaviour more strict. Though many, particularly the Ainoni, scoff at what they consider the affectation of antique ways, there can be little doubt that the resulting social discipline has served the Conriyans well. Since gaining its independence, Conriya has successfully weathered innumerable incursions, invasions, blockades, and embargoes, almost all of them due to the machinations of High Ainon.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Conriya’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High Ainon''' is a [[Ketyai]] nation of the eastern [[Three Seas]], and the only nation to be ruled by one of the [[The Schools|Schools]], the [[Scarlet Spires]].

Founded in 3372 after [[Sarothesser I]] defeated General [[Maurelta]] at the [[Battle of Charajat]], High Ainon has long been one of the most populous and powerful nations of the Three Seas. The agricultural production of the [[Secharib Plains]] combined with that of the [[River Sayut]] Delta and Valley supports both an extensive [[caste]]-nobility (noted for their wealth and their obsession with [[jnan]]) and an aggressive mercantilism. Ainoni ships can be found berthed in every port in the Three Seas. During the [[Scholastic Wars]] (3796-3818), the School of the Scarlet Spires, which is based in the capital, [[Carythusal]], managed to destroy the army of King [[Horziah III]] and assumed indirect control of the nation’s primary institutions. The nominal head of state, the King-Regent, answers directly to the Grandmaster.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘High Ainon’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2638">[[File:ScarletSchoolman sm.jpg|thumb|300px]]The '''Scarlet Spires''' are the most powerful [[Anagogic]] [[School]] of the Three Seas and de factor ruler of [[High Ainon]].

==History==

The roots of the Scarlet Spires reach as far back as ancient [[Shir]] (to this day traditionalists within the School refer to themselves as the "shiradi"). In many ways the development of the Scarlet Spires exemplifies the development of every Three Seas School, that of loose networks of [[sorcery|sorcerous]] practicioners becoming progressively more organized and insular in the face of chronic, religiously motivated persecution. Originally called the Surartu -- "Hooded Singers" -- the Scarlet Spires secured the river fortress of [[Kiz]] in [[Carythusal]] c. 1800 and emerged from the chaos surrounding the [[Apocalypse]], the collapse of Shir, and the Great Pestilence as one of the most powerful factions in ancient Ainon. Sometime around 2350, Kiz was severely damaged in an earthquake and subsequently covered with red enamel tiles in the reconstruction, thus leading to the School's now-famous moniker.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Scarlet Spires'&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol of the Scarlet Spires is a three-headed serpent.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Three-Headed Serpent'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation in the Holy War==

In 4100, the then-Grandmaster of the Scarlet Spires, [[Sasheoka]], was assassinated by the [[Cishaurim]], who believed the Scarlet Spires responsible for [[skin-spies]] discovered in [[Shimeh]]. Sasheoka's successor as Grandmaster, [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]], sought vengeance, and waged a secret war against the Cishaurim for ten years. When a [[Holy War]] was announced against the [[Fanim]] by [[Maithanet]], Shriah of the [[Thousand Temples]], in 4110, the Scarlet Spires agreed to offer their support.

The Scarlet Spires wished to minimize their involvement in the conflict, as they were few in number and significant losses could reduce the standing of the School. As such, they took to the field only when Cishaurim were present among the enemy forces.

The Istyuli Plains were once the breadbasket of Eärwa, teeming with villages, towns and farmsteads feeding the great nations of [[Kûniüri]], [[Sheneor]], [[Akksersia]] and [[Aörsi]]. Millennia before that they formed part of the [[Reach]] or dominion of the [[Nonman]] [[Mansions]] of [[Nihrimsul]] and [[Siöl]].

During the [[First Apocalypse]], those nations were laid low by the teeming masses of [[Sranc]] unleashed by the [[No-God]]. Since the end of that conflict the Sranc have remained in firm control of the plains. The [[Great Ordeal]] of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] marched onto the Istyuli Plains in 4132, planning to breach the armies of Sranc to reach and destroy fell [[Golgotterath]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The White-Luck Warrior]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anasûrimbor Ganrelka II''' was the successor of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]] and the last reigning High King of [[Kûniüri]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ganrelka II, Anasûrimbor’&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganrelka was Celmomas II’s heir, and took part in the [[Second Ordeal]]. He was present at the disastrous [[Battle of Eleneöt Fields]], where Celmomas was struck down, but was rescued from danger by five knights of [[Trysë]]. In 2147, following the complete annihilation of Kûniüri by the unopposed Horde of the [[No-God]], Ganrelka and his court escaped to the hidden fortress of [[Ishuäl]] in the remote [[Demua Mountains]]. While the utter secrecy of the fortress’s location prevented the No-God from assailing it, Ganrelka and all his family—save his bastard son—perished of the plague within months.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Prologue&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Iswolor]] (King, reigned ?-?)&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Iswolor is not confirmed to have been a king of the Ûmeri Empire, but it is likely this was the case, as it is mentioned he died in the Plains of Agongorea, "his bones as old as Ûmerau".&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nincaerû-Telesser|Nincaerû-Telesser I]] (fourth God-King, reigned 588-642)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Nincaerû-Telesser'&lt;/ref&gt;

As the same dates of birth and death are given for Nincaerû-Telesser II in the Encyclopedic Glossary, it's possible they were intended to be the same individual and the name "Nincama-Telesser" is either a mistake or an alternate name for Nincaerû-Telesser II. If the dates given in ''The False Sun'' are not considered canonical, it is possible that Nincama-Telesser instead reigned between Nincaerû-Telesser I and Nincaerû-Telesser II.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wulta-Ongorean]] (Emperor, reigned ?-?)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Wulta-Ongorean is never actually referred to as a ruler of the Ûmeri Empire; this assumption and his title of Emperor are based on the fact that his daughter Avalunsil became Empress after his death.&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2188">[[File:Ce_Tydonn.png|thumb|400px|Ce Tydonn in 4109.]]'''Ce Tydonn''' is a [[Norsirai]] nation of the [[Three Seas]], located north of [[Conriya]] on the eastern shoreline of the [[Meneanor|Meneanor Sea]], founded in 3742 in the wake of [[Cengemis]]’s collapse.

==History==
The first mention of the Tydonni is found in [[Casidas]]’s ''[[The Annals of Cenei]],'' where he mentions their raids across the [[River Swa]]. Descendants of the White Norsirai refugees from the [[Apocalypse]], the ancestors of the Tydonni are thought to have occupied the southern regions of the [[Dameöri Wilderness]] for centuries, prevented by their native fractiousness and infighting from causing much difficulty for their southern [[Ketyai]] neighbours. However, at some point in the thirty-eighth century, they united into one army, and with little difficulty they attacked and overwhelmed the people of Cengemis at the [[Battle of Marswa]] in 3722. The Cengemi were subjugated by the Tydonni, who settled down in their land. But it wasn’t until King [[Haul-Namyelk]] finally succeeded in unifying the various Tydonni tribes under his absolute authority in 3741 that Ce Tydonn proper came into existence.

==Culture==
Perhaps the most peculiar and distinctive predilection of the Tydonni is found in their racial beliefs. ''Ti dunn'' literally means “struck iron” in their tongue, reflecting their old belief that their people have been purified and pruned by the ordeal of the Apocalypse and the crucible of their long wandering through the harsh Dameöri Wilderness. They hold that this gives them “privileged blood,” rendering them morally, intellectually, and physically superior to other races. They believe the darker-skinned races to be unclean and polluted, and look down upon them. This has made the Tydonni cruel overlords of their Cengemi subjects, who have often rebelled against them.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ce Tydonn’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1532">'''''Isûphiryas''''' (“Great Pit of Years” in Ihrimsû) is the great work chronicling the history of the [[Nonmen]] prior to the [[Gates of Eärwa|Breaking of the Gates]]. In all likelihood it is the most ancient text in existence.

Sometime in the fourth century, a copy of the ''Isûphiryas'' was given to [[Cûnwerishau]] by [[Nil’giccas]], the Nonman King of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]], as part of the ancient treaty between their two peoples—the first between Nonmen and [[Men]]. During the reign of the God-King [[Carû-Ongonean]], five [[Ûmeri Empire|Ûmeri]] translations of the ''Isûphiryas'' were bequeathed to the [[Library of Sauglish]]. Four of these were destroyed in the [[Apocalypse]]. The fifth was saved by [[Seswatha]], who delivered it to the scribes of the [[Three Seas]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ''‘Isûphiryas’''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excerpts==
‘And [[Inchoroi|they]] forged counterfeits from our frame, [[Sranc|creatures]] vile and obscene, who hungered only for violent congress. These beasts they loosed upon the land, where they multiplied, no matter how fierce the [[Ishroi]] who hunted them. And soon Men clamoured at our gates, begging sanctuary, for they could not contend with the creatures. “They wear your face,” the penitents cried. “This calamity is your issue.” But we were wroth, and turned them away, saying, “These are not our Sons. And you are not our Brothers.”’&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishuäl was constructed to be the secret fastness of the [[Kûniüri]]c High Kings. Following the fall of Kûniüri during the [[Apocalypse]], [[Anasûrimbor Ganrelka II]] and his court fled to Ishuäl. However, they succumbed to plague soon after; the only survivor was a young bastard prince. In 2147, a group of [[Dûnyain]] monks found Ishuäl, and occupied it in isolation for almost two thousand years.{{EG|Ishuäl}}{{1|P}}

In 4132, [[Drusas Achamian]] and [[Mimara]] locate Ishuäl using a map that had been hidden in the [[Coffers]] of the [[Library of Sauglish]],{{5|15}} but it appears to have been destroyed.{{5|Interlude}}

'''Nanor-Ukkerja I''' (“Hammer of Heaven” in Kûniüric from Ûmeritic ''nanar hukisha'') was the first Anasûrimbor High King. His defeat of the [[Scintya]] in 1408 led to the founding of [[Kûniüri]] and began what most scholars regard as the longest-reigning [[Anasûrimbor Dynasty|dynasty]] in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Nanor-Ukkerja I’&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his long life (he lived to the age of 178, the reputed result of the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] blood in his veins), Nanor-Ukkerja I extended Kûniüri to the [[Yimaleti Mountains]] in the north, to the westernmost coasts of the [[Cerish|Cerish Sea]] in the east, to [[Sakarpus]] in the south, and to the [[Demua Mountains]] in the west. At his death, he divided this empire between his sons, creating [[Aörsi]] and [[Sheneor]] in addition to Kûniüri proper.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kûniüri’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shaeönanra''' (“Gift of Light” in Ûmeritic) is the current Grandvizier of the [[Mangaecca]] and one of the founders of the [[Consult]].

Shaeönanra was the son of a treasurer and grew up in [[Ûmerau]] at the time of the [[Cond]] Yoke. Demonstrating an aptitude for sorcery at a young age, he was taken in the [[the Schools|Schools]] and soon became a rising star within the Mangaecca. He was also a cunning political mind, and kept a network of spies in the Cond Empire. As the Grandvizier of the Mangaecca, he led the School to unprecedented heights. According to legend, Shaeönanra went mad while studying the [[Incû-Holoinas]], and his subsequent acts saw him convicted of impiety and his School outlawed in 1123.

[[File:FalseSun.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Glorious Pupil, Titirga, Grandmaster of the Sohonc, shines the famed Day Lantern on Shaeönanra, Grandmaster of the Mangaecca and dread leader of the Unholy Consult.]]

The greatest prodigy of his age, Shaeönanra claimed to have rediscovered a means of saving the souls of those damned by [[sorcery]]. He reputedly spent his life investigating various soul-trapping sorceries in the hope of avoiding passage to the [[Outside]]—and to great effect, given that he allegedly continues to live some three thousand years afterward, though in an obscene and unnatural manner.

By the fourteenth century the [[Trysë|Trysean]] annals began referring to him as '''Shauriatas''' (“Cheater of Gods” in Ûmeritic), instead.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Shaeönanra’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Shauriatas’&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
When [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] entered [[Golgotterath]], he was shown not what he expected, but two Larvae, one of which was Shauriatas, or Shaeönanra. A group of [[Dûnyain]] [[Thought Dancers|Thought-Dancers]] appeared, winking both grovelling Larvae out of existence. They explained they had taken the Consult over from within, and that all but Shauriatas had given in to their demands, and therefore he was the only one to be severely punished.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:44-365.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Galeoth Warrior by [http://spiralhorizon.deviantart.com/ SpiralHorizon]]][[File:Galeoth.png|thumb|400px|Galeoth in 4109.]]

Following the [[Apocalypse]], countless thousands of [[Meöri Empire|Meöri]] refugees settled the environs north of [[Huösi|Lake Huösi]]. Though nominally tributary to the [[Ceneian Empire]], surviving records indicate that the “Galoti,” as the Ceneians called them, were a fractious and warlike people. At some point in the thirty-fifth century, sedentary kingdoms began to displace the pastoral tribes along the [[River Vindauga]] and [[River Sculpa]]. Galeoth proper did not arise until ''c.'' 3683, when King [[Norwain I]] reputedly concluded twenty years of campaigning and conquest by having his captive foes butchered en masse in the reception hall of [[Moraör]], the great palace complex of the Galeoth Kings.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Galeoth’&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a commonly-believed legend that the famed fractiousness of the Galeoth derives from a curse laid on their Meöri forefathers by the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] King [[Gin’yursis]], who was betrayed and killed by the hero [[Nostol]] and his Meöri comrades after the [[Battle of Kathol Pass]]. In actuality, Gin’yursis was not so discriminate; he placed his curse on all [[Men]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gin'yursis.JPG|thumb|300px|Gin’yursis after becoming the Wight-in-the-Mountain at Cil-Aujas.]]
'''Gin’yursis''' was the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] King of [[Cil-Aujas]] during the [[Apocalypse]].

Gin’yursis was alive as far back as the [[Nonman Tutelage]]; his greatest student was [[Sos-Praniura]], who founded the [[Mangaecca]] in 684.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Mangaecca’&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 2151, Gin’yursis allied with a band of [[Meöri Empire|Meöri]] led by the hero [[Nostol]]. The forces succeeded in holding back the Horde of the [[No-God]] at the [[Battle of Kathol Pass]], which would be the only victory during the [[Years of the Crib]]. However, the following spring, the resentment of the [[Men]] towards the Nonmen led them to betray their allies. The Nonmen of Cil-Aujas were massacred, including Gin’yursis. Common legend holds that the famous fractiousness of the [[Galeoth]] is due to a curse placed on their Meöri forefathers by Gin’yursis. In actuality, Gin’yursis was not so discriminate in his dying; he cursed all Men.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because Cil-Aujas was a [[topoi|topos]], Gin’yursis survived past his death as a ghostly apparition, the Wight-in-the-Mountain. He continued to haunt the halls of Cil-Aujas until 4132, when [[Mimara]] exorcized him using a [[Chorae]] and her [[Judging Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1954">'''Caraskand''' is a major city and great caravan entrepôt of the southwestern [[Three Seas]]. It is the administrative and commercial capital of [[Enathpaneah]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Caraskand’&lt;/ref&gt; Caraskand was the site of a [[Battle of Caraskand|pivotal battle]] in 4112 between the host of [[Kascamandri ab Tepherokar]], the [[Padirajah]] of [[Kian]], and the [[Holy War|First Holy War]] under [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Battle of Caraskand’&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is built on nine heights, five of which surround its central quarter known as the Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘The Bowl’&lt;/ref&gt; The Heights of the Bull are the location of the Fama Palace, the residence and administrative seat of the [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Warrior-Prophet]] during the First Holy War’s stay at Caraskand.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Heights of the Bull’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Fama Palace’&lt;/ref&gt; The Sapatishah’s Palace is located on the Kneeling Heights.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Sapatishah’s Palace’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kneeling Heights’&lt;/ref&gt;

Caraskand’s outermost fortifications are known as the Triamic Walls, and were raised by [[Triamis the Great]] in 2568.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Triamic Walls’&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its main gates are the Gate of Horns, and its northernmost gate, the Ivory Gate, so named because of the pale limestone used to construct it.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Gate of Horns’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ivory Gate’&lt;/ref&gt;

Caraskand also houses the [[Csokis]], a derelict [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] temple complex located in the great campus of [[Kalaul]], which was the site of the Warrior-Prophet’s Circumfixion beneath [[Umiaki]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Csokis’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Kalaul’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Umiaki’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1006">The '''Meöri Empire''' (or '''Meörn Empire''') is a lost nation of the Ancient North.

Founded as a trading stronghold by [[Akksersia]]n colonists c. 850, the city of [[Kelmeöl]] grew rapidly, and its people, the Meöri, progressively asserted more and more authority over the neighbouring White [[Norsirai]] tribes. By the time [[Borswelka I]] was declared King in 1021, it had become an agressive, militaristic city-state. By the time his grandson [[Borswelka II]] died in 1104, it had conquered most of the [[River Vosa]] Basin and had established trading contracts with [[Shir]] to the south through a series of forts along the [[River Wernma]]. Strategically situated, and without any regional competitors, the Meöri Empire, as it came to be called, flourished as a mercantile nation. It collapsed with the destruction of Kelmeöl in 2150 during the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Meöri Empire’&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mallahet by spiralhorizon-d7xx9ba.jpg|thumb|300px|The notorious Cishaurim sorcerer-priest, Mallahet]]
The '''Cishaurim''' are the notorious priest-[[sorcerer]]s of the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] based in [[Shimeh]].

According to the Fanim religious tradition, the Prophet [[Fane]] became the first of the Cishaurim after he went blind in the desert. Given Fane’s claim that the true power of the [[Solitary God]] cannot be exercised so long as one sees the profane world, Cishaurim initiates voluntarily blind themselves at a certain point in their study, enabling to dispense the “divine water” of the “[[Psûkhe]],” as the Cishaurim refer to it. Little is known about the metaphysics of the Psûkhe beyond the fact that it cannot be perceived by the [[The Few|Few]] and that it is in many ways almost as formidable as the [[Anagogis|Anagogic]] practice of the [[The Schools|Schools]].

The [[Scarlet Spires]] categorize individual Cishaurim according to their power: Tertiaries, or those with only the most rudimentary strength; Secondaries, or those with strength comparable to sorcerous initiates; and Primaries, those with strength exceeding that of initiates (but still, according to the Scarlet Magi, short of the strength possessed by true Anagogic sorcerers of rank).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cishaurim’&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Psûkhe is also known as the Water of Indara,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Fane’&lt;/ref&gt; the Cishaurim are sometimes referred to as [[Indara-Kishauri]]: “Indara’s Water-bearers.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Indara-Kishauri’&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview R. Scott Bakker explains "Everything comes down to &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; in Eärwa. Where sorcery is representational, utilizing either the logical form (as with the Gnosis) or the material content (as with the Anagogis) of meaning to leverage transformations of reality, the Psukhe utilizes the &lt;em&gt;impetus&lt;/em&gt;. Practitioners of the Psukhe blind themselves to see through the what and grasp the how, the pure performative kernel of meaning–the music, the passion, or as the Cishaurim call it, the ‘Water.’ As a contemporary philosopher might say, the Psukhe is &lt;em&gt;noncognitive&lt;/em&gt;, it has no truck with warring versions of reality, which is why it possesses no Mark and remains invisible to the Few."

[[Siöl]], the oldest and greatest of the [[Nonmen]] Mansions, lay under the northern Great Kayarsus, guarding a fortified series of passes leading east into the continent of [[Eänna]]. According to some historians, [[Siöl]] itself is the [[Gates of Eärwa|Gate of Thayant]], the shattering of which marks the beginning of dated human history and the commencing of the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Glossary II, 'Siöl'&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the Gate of Thayant, no other major pass linking Eärwa to Eänna is known to exist, although one in the vicinity of [[Jekhia]] in far north-eastern [[High Ainon]] is likely, given the history of that region and the cultural influence of the [[Xiuhianni]], the only one of the [[Five Tribes of Men]] to remain in Eänna.

According to legend, the pestilence swept up from the No-God’s ashes after his destruction at the hands of [[Anaxophus V]] in 2155. [[Mandate]] scholars dispute this, claiming that the No-God’s body was recovered by the [[Consult]] and interred in [[Golgotterath]]. Whatever the cause, the Indigo Plague ranks as among the worst in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Indigo Plague’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="890">'''Viramsata''', "many-breaths", is a game played in southern [[Nilnamesh]].

Viramsata is a game of truth. The players tell lies about who said what to whom, about who makes love to whomever, and so on. They do this continually, and what is more, they are at pains to act out the lies told by others, especially when they are elegant, so they might make them true. And so it goes from tongue to lip to tongue, until no distinction remains between what is a lie and what is true.

In the end, at a great ceremony, it is the most compelling tale that is declare ''Pirvirsut'', a word that means 'this breath is ground' in ancient Vaparsi. The weak, the inelegant, have died, while others grow strong, yielding only to the Pirvirsut, the Breath-that-is-Ground.

The viramsata become living things, and humans are their battleground.{{3|16}}

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1285">The '''Nail of Heaven''' is the northern star that, aside from being the brightest in the night sky (it is sometimes visible in daylight), provides the axis from which all other stars revolve.{{EG|Nail of Heaven}} The [[Nonmen]] called it ‘''Imburil''’, meaning ‘the ''Newborn''’.&lt;ref&gt;[[The False Sun]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tenets of [[Inrithism]], [[Inri Sejenus]] ascended to the Nail of Heaven after his death in 2202.{{EG|Inri Sejenus}}

{{Blockquote|In the slot of a hanging ravine, the Nail of Heaven twinkled alone in the endless blue, a beacon of all things high and open…&lt;br&gt;A final call to those who would dare the nethers of the earth.{{4|11}}}}

== Nature ==
One night the star suddenly blazed with a strange, sudden intensity. This waxing lasted a time and then abated. The Cûnuroi could not explain it, but then dismissed it as a curiosity and moved on with their lives. Three years after this curious event, the [[Incû-Holoinas]] fell down.

This may mean that the Nail of Heaven is not an actual star but rather a wormhole Incû-Holoinas came through or even a mother-ship with Incû-Holoinas being a drop-ship. The fact that Nonmen call this star 'Newborn' support either of this.

Iothiah is the location of the great [[Sareötic Library]], which in the time of the [[Ceneian Empire]] was one of the greatest libraries in the known world. The so-called “script law” of Iothiah forced, on punishment of death, all visitors bearing books to surrender them for copying and inclusion in the Library. Though the Sareöts were massacred when Shigek fell to the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] in 3933, Padirajah [[Fan’oukarji III]] spared the Library when he found it contained maps useful for his [[Dagger Jihad|Jihad]], thinking it the will of the [[Solitary God]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Sareotic Library’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">'''Eämnor''' is a lost White [[Norsirai]] nation of the [[Ancient North]].

The roots of Eämnor reach back to the days of [[Aulyanau]] the Conqueror and the Cond Yoke. In 927, Aulyana conquered the fortress of [[Ara-Etrith]] ("New Etrith") and, struck by the anarcane characteristics of [[Mount Ankulakai]], settled several [[Cond]] tribes in the vicinity. These tribes flourished, and under the influence of the nearby cities of the [[River Aumris]] they quickly abandoned their pastoral ways. In fact the Cond were so effectively assimilated into Aumris culture that their White Norsirai cousins, the [[Scintya]], took them for High Norsirai during the time of the Scintya Yoke (1228-1381).

Eämnor properly emerged from the Scintya Yoke as one of the pre-eminent nations of the Ancient North. Though laid waste in 2148, Eämnor could be considered the sole surviving nation of the [[Apocalypse]], insofar as [[Atrithau]] survived. Due to the concentrations of [[Sranc]], however, Atrithau has never been able to recover more than a fraction of the lands constituting historical Eämnor.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Eämnor'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities and Provinces==
* [[Atrithau]]
* [[Sobel]]

The '''Anagogis''' is a branch of [[sorcery]] that turns on the resonance between meanings and concrete things.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Anagogis’&lt;/ref&gt; It uses creative metaphors to implement sorcery.

The Anagogis is generally considered inferior to the [[Gnosis]] because it works through Analogies as opposed to Abstractions: the Anagogic sorcerers can summon only an imitation of a dragon which spews out fire, while Gnostic sorcerers can summon heat itself.

==Anagogic Schools==
* [[Imperial Saik]]
* [[Mikka Council]]
* [[Mysunsai]]
* [[Nilitar Compact]]
* [[Oaranat]]
* [[Scarlet Spires]]
* [[Vokalati]]

==Spells==
* The Dragonhead
* The Houlari Twin-Tempests
* The Iswazi Cant
* The Memkotic Furies
* The Meppa Cataract
* The Portcullis
* The Ramparts of Ur
* The Uruborian Circle

==Trivia==
* The branches of sorcery all take their names from Greek words. “Anagogis” comes from the Greek word “Αναγωγής,” meaning “Comparison.”

[[File:Mallahet by spiralhorizon-d7xx9ba.jpg|thumb|300px|The notorious Cishaurim sorcerer-priest, Mallahet]]
The '''Psûkhe''' is the arcane practice of the [[Cishaurim]], much like [[sorcery]], though cruder in its exercise, and distinguished by its invisibility to the [[The Few|Few]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Psûkhe’&lt;/ref&gt;

While wielding [[Gnosis|Gnostic]] and [[Anagogis|Anagogic]] sorcery requires intellectual strength, one’s ability to wield the Psûkhe is relative to one’s passions. Practitioners of the Psûkhe blind themselves to the profane world as part of their studies.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cishaurim’&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of the Psûkhe are called '''psûkari.'''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘psûkari’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* The branches of sorcery all take their names from Greek words. “Psûkhe” comes from the Greek word “Ψυχή,” meaning “Soul”.

'''Ekyannus III''', “the Golden,” was [[Shriah]] of the [[Thousand Temples]]. He is famous for converting his friend [[Triamis the Great]] to [[Inrithism]] in 2505, thus resulting in Inrithism being declared the official state religion of the [[Ceneian Empire]]. This led to Inrithism becoming the dominant religion in the [[Three Seas]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ekyannus III’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cû’jara-Cinmoi''' was the greatest of the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] Kings and the first great foe of the [[Inchoroi]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cû’jara-Cinmoi’&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Role in the Cûno-Inchoroi Wars==
Cû’jara-Cinmoi was the King of [[Siöl]] when the [[Incû-Holoinas]] plunged to the earth in the land of [[Viri]]. [[Nin’janjin]], the Nonman King of Viri, sent a letter to Cû’jara-Cinmoi begging his aid; instead, Cû’jara-Cinmoi sent an army and invaded. Viri became a tributary of Siöl. Cû’jara-Cinmoi dispatched the hero [[Ingalira]] to investigate the Incû-Holoinas, and Ingalira returned with two Inchoroi captives. Repelled by the obscenities, Cû’jara-Cinmoi had them put to death and set a Watch upon the Incû-Holoinas.

Cû’jara-Cinmoi proceeded to conquer the Mansions of [[Nihrimsul]] and [[Cil-Aujas]]. However, the Inchoroi sent a secret embassy to Nin’janjin, who allied with them against Cû’jara-Cinmoi. The Nonmen of Viri rose up in revolt against rule of Cû’jara-Cinmoi; at the same time, hordes of Inchoroi poured from the Incû-Holoinas.

However, the Nonmen of Viri were appalled when they actually looked upon the Inchoroi, and turned on Nin’janjin, who attempted to flee. The Inchoroi then turned on the Nonmen, hoping to destroy them before Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s forces arrived.

The first conflict of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] occurred at [[Fields of Eleneöt|Fields of Pir Pahal]]. The [[Battle of Pir Pahal]] raged through the night and into the following morning, but the Nonmen eventually prevailed. Cû’jara-Cinmoi struck down the Inchoroi King, [[Sil]], and took his weapon, the [[Heron Spear]].

After the Battle of Pir Pahal, emboldened by Siöl’s distraction, Nihrimsul and Cil-Aujas had revolted.

After years of hard campaigning, Cû’jara-Cinmoi finally brought the [[Ishroi]] of Cil-Aujas to heel, but King [[Sin’niroiha]] and the Ishroi of Nihrimsul continued to resist him. The ''[[Isûphiryas]]'' chronicles dozens of bloody yet indecisive confrontations between the two Kings: the Battle of Ciphara, the Battle of Hilcyri, the Siege of Asargoi. Proud beyond reason, Cû’jara-Cinmoi refused to relent, and put to death every embassy Sin’niroiha sent to him. Only when Sin’niroiha became King of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]] through marriage did the High King of Siöl concede. “A King of Three Mansions,” he is said to have declared, “may be Brother to a King of Two.”

Many years later, when Cû’jara-Cinmoi began growing old and frail, Nin’janjin returned begging Mercy and Penance. Cû’jara-Cinmoi was shocked to see that Nin’janjin had not aged. Cû’jara-Cinmoi offered peace with the Inchoroi in exchange for their secrets of immortality. He allowed the Inchoroi to move freely among the Nonmen, distributing the remedies that would make them immortal and doom them all.

The first victim of the Womb-Plague was Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s wife, [[Hanalinqû]]. As all the women of the Nonmen died, Cû’jara-Cinmoi realized the Inchoroi had betrayed him and called the Nonmen to war.

The Nonmen and the Inchoroi met in battle on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]], the Black Furnace Plain. But the Inchoroi had learned much since the Battle of Pir Pahal; they now wielded [[Chorae]], [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag]]s, and [[Wracu]]. Though the Nonmen fought valiantly, Cû’jara-Cinmoi was slain, struck down by his old foe Nin’janjin. The remaining Nonmen went on to win the battle, then returned to their Mansions and awaited their inevitable doom.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

Cû’jara-Cinmoi was succeeded as High King by [[Nil’giccas]], who made [[qirri]] from his predecessor’s body.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagol''' was Shriah of the [[Thousand Temples]] from 3371 until his assassination in 3383.

Diagol was known for his cruel excesses, and his reign prompted the high clergy to issue the [[Writ of Psata-Antyu]] in 3386, limiting the power of future Shriahs.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Writ of Psata-Antyu’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1653">'''''The Tractate''''' is the writings of [[Inri Sejenus]] and his disciples, forming the second part of the [[Inrithi]] scriptural canon.

The Inrithi believe ''The Tractate'' to be the prophesied culmination of ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', an embodiment of the Covenant of [[Gods]] and [[Men]] for the realities of a new age. Among its seventeen books are various accounts of the life of the Latter Prophet, many parables for the purposes of moral instruction, and Inri Sejenus's own explanation of the "Intervention" he himself represents: that mankind, as it matures, will become more and more able to worship the God in His "singular multiplicity". Given that ''The Tractate'' was written more as a testament to the divinity of Inri Sejenus's vision than out of any real commitment to historical rigor, it is impossible to assess the veracity of the text. [[Zarathinius]] and, more recently, [[Fanim]] commentators have pointed out several glaring inconsistencies in the text, but nothing that Inrithi apologists have not been able to explain away&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 495, 'Tractate, The'&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Excerpts==
Scholars 36, 21: "...though he consorts with man, woman, and child, though he lays with beasts and makes a mockery of his seed, never shall he be as licentious as the philosopher, who lays with all things imaginable."&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 12, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars 7:16: "For He sees gold in the wretched and excrement in the exalted. Nay, the world is not equal in the eyes of the God."&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 4, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="987">'''''A Defence of the Arcane Arts''''' is the famed sorcerous apologia of [[Zarathinius]], which is as widely cited by philosophers as [[sorcerer]]s because of its pithy critiques not only of the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] prohibition of [[sorcery]] but of Inrithism itself. The work has long been banned by the [[Thousand Temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ''‘Defence of the Arcane Arts, A’''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excerpts==
“If the world is a game whose rules are written by [[God of Gods|God]], and sorcerers are those who cheat and cheat, then who has written the rules of sorcery?”&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

“If the Gods did not pretend to be human, [[Men]] would recoil from them as from spiders.”&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

“No two prophets agree. So to spare our prophets their feelings, we call the future a whore.”&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shikol''' was the King of ancient [[Xerash]], famed for sentencing [[Inri Sejenus]] to death in 2198, as recounted in ''[[The Tractate]]''.

For obvious reasons, Shikol's name has become synonymous with moral corruption among the [[Inrithi]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Shikol'&lt;/ref&gt; His instrument of judgement, a gilded thighbone, is the most potent symbol of evil in Inrithism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">The '''''Third Analytic of Men''''' is a work by [[Ajencis]], regarded by many to be his magnum opus.

The ''Third Analytic'' interrogates the aspects of human nature that make knowledge possible, as well as the human weaknesses that make knowledge so difficult to attain. As Ajencis notes, "if all [[Men]] disagree on all matters, then most Men confuse deception for truth". He investigates the reasons, not only for deception in general, but for the erroneous sense of conviction that sustains it, giving what has come to be called the "selfish knower" thesis, the idea that convenience, conditioning, and appeal (as opposed to evidence and rational argumentation) are the primary motivation for the beliefs of the vast majority&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 493, 'Third Analytic of Men, The'&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Excerpts==

"If it is only after that we understand what has come before, then we understand nothing. Thus we shall define the soul as follows: that which precedes everything."&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Prologue, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

"The world is a circle that possesses as many centers as it does men."&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 7, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

"The proposition "I am the center" need never be uttered. It is the assumption upon which all certainty and all doubt turns."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 3, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

"One can look into the future, or one can look at the future. The latter is by far the more instructive."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 9, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

"Love is lust made meaningful. Hope is hunger made human."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 10, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

"What is the meaning of a deluded life?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 25, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt;

"Death, in the strict sense, cannot be defined, for whatever predicate we, the living, attribute to it necessarily belongs to Life. This means that Death, as a category, behaves in a manner indistinguishable from the Infinite, and from [[God]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 12, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

"When a man possesses the innocence of a child, we call him a fool. When a child possesses the cunning of a man, we call him an abomination. As with love, knowledge has its season."&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Prologue, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

"The world is only as deep as we can see. This is why fools think themselves profound. This is why terror is the passion of revelation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 14, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is not so much the wisdom of the wise that saves us from the foolishness of the fools as it is the latter's inability to agree."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 2, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

"Everything is concealed always. Nothing is more trite than a mask."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 6, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

"Complexity begets ambiguity, which yields in all ways to prejudice and avarice. Complication does not so much defeat Men as arm them with fancy."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 8, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gods are epochal beings, not quite alive. Since the Now eludes them, they are forever divided. Sometimes nothing blinds souls more profoundly than the apprehension of the Whole. Men need recall this when they pray."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 13, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

"Any fool can see the limits of seeing, but not even the wisest know the limits of knowing. Thus is ignorance rendered invisible, and are all Men made fools."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 14, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="882">'''''The Epistemologies''''' is a work oft attributed to [[Ajencis]] but more likely a redacted compilation drawn from his other works.

Many consider ''The Epistemologies'' to be Ajencis's definitive philosophical statement on the nature of knowledge, but some argue that it distorts his position since it presents a unitary vision of views that actually evolved quite dramatically over the course of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Epistemologies, The'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extracts==

"To be ignorant and to be deceived are two different things. To be ignorant is to be a slave of the world. To be deceived is to be the slave of another man. The question will always be: Why, when all men are ignorant, and therefore already slaves, does this latter slavery sting us so?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the lack of any other extant nation along the coast of the Great Ocean, maritime trade and travel along the far western coasts is not commonplace (aside from that within Zeüm itself). Zeüm trades with the nations of the [[Three Seas]] through its southern ports and the straits separating the Ocean from the [[Oncis|Sea of Oncis]]. The only major use of the Great Ocean for a military campaign was during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], when the [[Nonman]] [[Mansion]] of [[Illisserû]] assaulted the [[Incû-Holoinas]] by sea. The attack was not successful, with most of the invading force destroyed in the [[Battle of Imogirion]]. The remnants of the fleet were sunk on the way back to the Three Seas by storms, demonstrating the dangers of entrusting any major military campaign to the vagaries of the weather.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Battle of Imogirion'&lt;/ref&gt;

It primarily consists of "The Kelmariad", the story of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]] and his tragic Ordeal; "The Kayûtiad", the account of Celmomas's son, [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]], and his heroic exploits; "The Book of Generals", the story of the deceptive events following Nau-Cayûti's murder; "The Trisiad", which recounts the great city of [[Trysë]]'s destruction; "The Eämnoriad", the story of ancient [[Atrithau]]'s expulsion of [[Seswatha]] and subsequent survival; "The Annals of Akksersa", which recounts the Fall of [[Akksersia]]; and lastly, "The Annal Sakarpa", or "The Refugee's Song" as it is sometimes called, the strange account of the city of [[Sakarpus]] during the Apocalypse.

Despite the scorn of [[Mandate]] scholars (or perhaps because of it), ''The Sagas'' possess an almost scriptural reputation in the [[Three Seas]].{{EG|Sagas, The}}

A number of different authors contributed to the ''Sagas'', but only two are named: [[Heyorthau]] and [[Nau-Ganor]].{{3|8}}

==Excerpts==
On the [[Mengedda Plains]]: "The soul that encounters [[No-God|Him]] passes no further."{{EG|[The] soul that encounters Him passes no further}}

A warring we have come&lt;br /&gt;
A reaving we shall work.&lt;br /&gt;
And when the day is done,&lt;br /&gt;
In our eyes the Gods shall lurk!{{2|6}}

Rage -- Goddess! Sing of your flight&lt;br /&gt;
From our fathers and our sons.&lt;br /&gt;
Away, Goddess! Secret your divinity!&lt;br /&gt;
From the conceit that makes kings of fools,&lt;br /&gt;
From the scrutiny that makes corpses of souls.&lt;br /&gt;
Mouths open, arms thrown wide, we beseech thee:&lt;br /&gt;
Sing us the end of your song.{{3|8}}

On the birth of Anasûrimbor Celmomas II: "His rosy wail could not stir [[Anasûrimbor Huörmomas|his brother]]'s blue slumber."{{3|8}}

Grim kinsman, frosting the breath of his every counsel.&lt;br /&gt;
Dark reflection! Even the Knight-Chieftans bundle their cloaks&lt;br /&gt;
When they catch your glint in their Lord's eye.{{3|8}}

The pyres gutted, the towers fallen and black,&lt;br&gt;
The foeman glutted, our glory slung 'cross his back,&lt;br&gt;
The world's keel broken, our blood thinner than our tears.&lt;br&gt;
The story spoken, as though the dead possessed ears.{{3|8}}

According in Thunyeri legend, their peoples migrated down the length of the [[River Wernma]], continually pressured by the [[Sranc]] tribes that largely rule the great forests of the [[Dameöri Wilderness]]. For two hundred years the Thunyeri plied the Three Seas as pirates and raiders. Then, in 3987, after three generations of [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] missionaries had largely converted them from their traditional [[Kiünnat]] beliefs, the tribes elected their first King, [[Hringa Hurrausch]], and began adopting the institutions of their Three Seas neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Thunyerus’&lt;/ref&gt;

Thunyeri are typically described as having long beards.

==Excerpts==
“If all human events possess purpose, then all human deeds possess purpose. And yet when men vie with men, the purpose of no man comes to fruition: the result always falls somewhere in between. The purpose of deeds, then, cannot derive from the purposes of men, because all men vie with all men. This means the deeds of men must be willed by something other than men. From this it follows that we are all slaves. Who then is our Master?”&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

“The vulgar think the [[God of Gods|God]] by analogy to man and so worship Him in the form of the [[Gods]]. The learned think the God by analogy to principles and so worshp Him in the form of Love or Truth. But the wise think the God not at all. They know that thought, which is finite, can only do violence to the God, who is infinite.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

“In life, your soul is but the extension of your body, which reaches inwards until it finds its centre in spirit. In death, your body is but the extension of your soul, which reaches outward until it finds its circumference in flesh. In both instances, all things appear the same. Thus are the dead and the living confused.”&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excerpts==

"Souls can no more see the origins of their thought than they can see the backs of their heads or the insides of their entrails. And since souls cannot differentiate what they cannot see, there is a peculiar sense in which the soul cannot self-differentiate. So it is always, in a peculiar sense, the same time when they think, the same place where they think, and the same individual who does the thinking. Like tipping a spiral on its side until only a circle can be seen, the passage of moments always remains now, the carnival of spaces always sojourns here, and the succession of people always becomes me. The truth is, if the soul could apprehend itself the way it apprehended the world -- if it could apprehend its origins -- it would see that there is no now, there is no here, and there is no me. In other words, it would realize that just as there is no circle, there is no soul."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 10, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

"If the immutable appears recast, then you yourself have been transformed."&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 15, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skuthula the Black''' is an ancient [[Wracu]] spawned during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], one of the few Dragons known to have survived the [[Apocalypse|Apocalypse.]] &lt;span&gt;He is described as "magnificent."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedic Glossary, 'Skuthula'''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Unholy Consult]]'', he is found during the battle for [[Golgotterath]] guarding the [[Intrinsic Gate]] where he battles the [[Witch]] [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]]. Although he is buried under tons of rubble, his fate is ultimately uncertain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The most serpentine of the Wracu, Skuthula's monstrous body consists mainly of spine and ribs with dozens of spindly legs along his underside. His legs move like that of a centipede. He is skinned in black scales that are about the size of Norsirai shields which reflect and shatter light like mirrors. Spear-long quills form a mane along the back of his neck, and a crest of white spines form a thicket about his crown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Excerpts==
“There are three, and only three, kinds of men in the world: cynics, fanatics, and [[Mandate]] Schoolmen.”{{1|1}}

“Men are forever pointing at others, which is why I always follow the knuckle and not the nail.”{{2|13}}

“They strike down the weak and call it justice. They ungird their loins and call it reparation. They bark like dogs and call it reason.”{{2|24}}

“Of course we make crutches of one another. Why else would we crawl when we lose our lovers?”{{3|6}}

“As a miller once told me, when the gears do not meet, they become as teeth. So it is with men and their machinations.”{{3|11}}

==Excerpts==
“Reason, [[Ajencis]] writes, is the capacity to overcome unprecedented obstacles in the gratification of desire. What distinguishes man from beasts is man’s capacity to overcome infinite obstacles through reason.&lt;br /&gt;
But Ajencis has confused the accidental for the essential. Prior to the capacity to ''overcome'' infinite obstacles is the capacity to ''confront'' them. What defines man is not that he reasons, but that he ''prays.''”&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

“Duty measures the distance between the animal and the divine.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

“If soot stains your tunic, dye it black. This is vengeance.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

“Ask the dead and they will tell you.&lt;br /&gt;
All roads are not equal.&lt;br /&gt;
Verily, even maps can sin.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

“There is morality and there is cowardice. The two are not to be confused, even though in appearance and effect they are so often the same.”&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

“Some say men continually war against circumstances, but I say they perpetually flee. What are the works of men if not a momentary respite, a hiding place soon to be discovered by catastrophe?

==Excerpts==

"Why must I conquer, you ask? War makes clear. Life or Death. Freedom or Bondage. War strikes the sediment from the water of life."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 5, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

"What is practicality but one moment betrayed for the next?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 11, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

"...and my soldiers, they say, make idols of their swords. But does not the sword make certain? Does not the sword make plain? Does not the sword compel kindness from those who kneel in its shadow? I need no other god."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 19, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

"I returned from that campaign a far different man, or so my mother continuously complained. "Now only the dead," she would tell me, "can hope to match your gaze.""&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought, Chapter 4, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

"If war does not kill the woman in us, it kills the man."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 15, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

"...conquered peoples live and die with the knowledge that survival does not suffer honor. They have chosen shame over the pyre, the slow flame for the quick."&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 7, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

"A beggar's mistake harms no one but the beggar. A king's mistake, however, harms everyone but the king. Too often, the measure of power lies not in the number who obey your will, but in the number who suffer your stupidity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 9, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

"The bondage we are born into is the bondage we cannot see. Verily, freedom is little more than the ignorance of tyranny. Live long enough, and you will see: Men resent not the whip so much as the hand that wields it."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 3, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excerpts==

"Every monumental work of the State is measured by cubits. Every cubit is measured by the length of the Aspect-Emperor's arm. And the Aspect-Emperor's arm, they say, stands beyond measure. But I say the Aspect-Emperor's arm is measured by the length of a cubit, and that all cubits are measured by the works of the State. Not even the All stands beyond measure, for it is more than what lies within it, and "more" is a kind of measure. Even the [[God]] has His cubits."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excerpts==

"How does one learn innocence? How does one teach ignorance? For to be them it to know them not. And yet they are the immovable point from which the compass of life swings, the measure of all crime and compassion, the rule of all wisdom and folly. They are the Absolute."&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 10, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Poet will yield up his stylus only when the Geometer can explain how Life can at once be a point and a line. How can all time, all creation, come to the now?

{{Blockquote|Like many old tyrants, I dote upon my grandchildren. I delight in their tantrums, their squealing laughter, their peculiar fancies. I willfully spoil them with honey sticks. And I find myself wondering at their blessed ignorance of the world and its million grinning teeth. Should I, like my grandfather, knock such childishness from them? Or should I indulge their delusions? Even now, as death’s shadowy pickets gather about me, I ask, why should innocence answer to the world? Perhaps the world should answer to innocence...&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I rather like that. I tire of bearing the blame.|Stajanas II, ''Ruminations''{{2|22}}}}

==Excerpts==

"I tell you, guilt dwells nowhere but in the eyes of the accuser. This men know even as they deny it, which is why they so often make murder their absolution. The truth of crime lies not with the victim but with the witness."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

"When others speak, I hear naught but the squawking of parrots. But when I speak, it always seems to be the first time. Each man is the rule of the other, no matter how mad or vain."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

"One cannot assume the truth of what one declares without presuming the falsity of all incongruous declarations. Since all men assume the truth of their own declarations, this presumption becomes at best ironic and at worst outrageous. Given the infinity of possible claims, who could be so vain as to think their dismal claims true? The tragedy, of course, is that we cannot but make declarations. So it seems we must speak as [[God]]s to converse as [[Men]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

"We belittle what we cannot bear. We make figments out of fundamentals, all in the name of preserving our own peculiar fancies. The best way to secure one's own deception is to accuse others of deceit."&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sirwitta''' is a criminal mentioned in the ''[[Isûphiryas]]''.

Sirwitta seduced the wife of a high-ranking [[Ishroi]] and conceived by her a daughter named [[Cimoira]]. It was the first recorded instance of interbreeding between [[Men]] and [[Nonmen]]. The truth of Cimoira was suppressed, and despite her mannish blood she was accepted as Cûnuroi. Sirwitta himself was banished to the Second Watch, which stood guard over the [[Incû-Holoinas]].

Somehow (the ''Isûphiryas'' does not go into detail) Sirwitta managed to enter the Incû-Holoinas. A month passed, and all thought him lost. Then he reappeared, deranged, screeching claims so alarming that [[Oirinas]] and [[Oirûnas]] brought him directly to [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]. What was said between Sirwitta and the High King of [[Siöl]] is not recorded. The chroniclers say only that Cû’jara-Cinmoi, after hearing Sirwitta speak, ordered him put to death. A later entry, however, describes Sirwitta as "tongueless and imprisoned". It appears the High King, for some unknown reason, had rescinded his warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Cûno-Inchoroi Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10225">The '''Compendium of the First Holy War''' is a work written by [[Drusas Achamian]] during the time between the end of ''[[The Thousandfold Thought (Book)|The Thousandfold Thought]]'' (c. 4112) and the beginning of ''[[The Judging Eye (Book)|The Judging Eye]]'' (c. 4131), detailing the events of the [[Holy War]]. It has been banned by [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].

==Excerpts==

"The author has often observed that in the genesis of great events, men generally possess no inkling of what their actions portend. The problem is not, as one might suppose, a result of men's blindness to the consequences of their actions. Rather it is a result of the mad way the dreadful turns on the trivial when the ends of one man cross the ends of another. The Schoolmen of the [[Scarlet Spires]] have an old saying: "When one man chases a hare, he finds a hare. But when many men chase a hare, they find a [[dragon]]." In the prosecution of competing human interests, the result is always unknown, and all too often terrifying."{{1|1}}

"But despite stories of [[Fanim]] atrocities, the fact of the matter is that the Kianene, heathen or no, were suprisingly tolerant of [[Inrithi]] pilgrimages to [[Shimeh]] -- before the [[Holy War]], that is. Why would a people devoted to the destruction of the [[Tusk]] extend this courtesy to "idolaters"? Perhaps they were partially motivated by the prospect of trade, as others have suggested. But the fundamental motive lies in their desert heritage. The Kianene word for a holy place is ''si'ihkhalis'', which means, literally, "great oasis". On the open desert it is their strict custom to never begrudge travellers water, even if they be enemies."{{1|4}}

"What the Men of the Tusk never understand was that the [[Nansur]] and the Kianene were ''old enemies''. When two civilized peoples find themselves at war for centuries, any number of common interests will arise in the midst of the pursuit of their greater antagonism. Ancestral foes share many things: mutual respect, a common history, triumph in stalemate, and a plethora of unspoken truces. The Men of the Tusk were interlopers, an impertinent flood that threatened to wash away the observed channels of a far older enmity."{{1|5}}

"...and in Old Sheyic, the language of the ruling and religious castes of the Nansurium, ''skilvenas'' means "catastrophe" or "apocalypse", as though the [[Scylvendi]] have somehow transcended the role of peoples in history and become a principle."{{1|6}}

"How shall one describe the terrible majesty of the Holy War? Even then, still unblooded, it was both frightening and wondrous to behold, a great beast whose limbs were comprised of entire nations -- [[Galeoth]], [[Thunyerus]], [[Ce Tydonn]], [[Conriya]], [[High Ainon]], and the Nansurium -- and with the Scarlet Spires as the dragon's maw, no less. Not since the days of the [[Ceneian Empire]] or the [[Ancient North]] has the world witnessed such an assembly. Even diseased by politics, it was a thing of awe."{{1|10}}

"I have explained how [[Maithanet]] yoked the vast resources of the [[Thousand Temples]] to ensure the viability of the Holy War. I have described, in detail, the first steps taken by the Emperor to bind the Holy War to his imperial ambitions. I have attempted to reconstruct the initial reaction of the [[Cishaurim]] in Shimeh from their correspondence with the Padirajah in [[Nenciphon]]. And I have even mentioned the hated [[Consult]], of whom I can at long last speak without ridicule. I have spoken, in other words, almost exclusively of powerful factions and their impersonal ends. What of vengeance? What of hope? Against the frame of competing nations and warring faiths, how did these small passions come to rule the Holy War?"{{1|12}}

"So who were the heroes and the cravens of the Holy War? There are already songs enough to answer that question. Needless to say, the Holy War provided further violent proof of [[Ajencis]]'s old proverb, "Though all men be equally frail before the world, the differences between them are terrifying.""{{1|13}}

"Many have condemned those who joined the Holy War for mercenary reasons, and doubtless, should this humble history find its way into their idle libraries, they will blast me as well. Admittedly, my reasons for joining the Holy War were "mercenary", if by that one means I joined in order to procure ends outside the destruction of the heathen and the reconquest of Shimeh. But there were a great many mercenaries such as myself, and like myself, they inadvertently furthered the Holy War by killing their fair share of heathen. The failure of the Holy War had nothing to do with us. Did I say failure? Perhaps "transformation" would be a better word."{{1|15}}

"Those of us who survived will always be bewildered when we recall his arrival. And not just because he was so different then. In a strange sense he never changed. We changed. If he seems so different to us now, it is because he was the figure that transformed the ground."{{1|16}}

"The event was unprecedented: not since the fall of [[Cenei]] to the Scylvendi hordes had so many potentates gathered in one place. But few knew Mankind itself lay upon the balance. And who could guess that a brief exchange of glances, not the Shriah's edict, would tip that balance? But is this not the very enigma of history? When one peers deep enough, one always finds that catastrophe and triumph, the proper objects of the historian's scrutiny, inevitably turn upon the small, the trivial, the nightmarishly accidental. When I reflect overmuch on this fact, I do not fear that we are "drunks at the sacred dance", as [[Protathis]] writes, but that there is no dance at all."{{1|17}}

"The Emperor, the consensus seems to be, was an excessively suspicious man. Fear has many forms, but it is never so dangerous as when it is combined with power and perpetual uncertainty."{{1|18}}

"...even though the [[skin-spies]] were exposed relatively early in the course of the Holy War, most believed the Cishaurim rather than the Consult to be responsible. This is the problem of all great revelations: their significance so often exceeds the frame of our comprehension. We understand only after, always after. Not simply ''when'' it is too late, but precisely ''because'' it is too late."{{1|19}}

"The days and weeks before battle are a strange thing. All the contingents, the Conriyans, the Galeoth, the Nansur, the Thunyeri, the Tydonni, the Ainoni, and the Scarlet Spires, marched to the fortress of [[Asgilioch]], to the Southron Gates and the heathen frontier. And though many bent their thoughts to [[Skauras ab Nalajan|Skauras]], the heathen Sapatishah who would contest us, he was still woven of the same cloth as a thousand other abstract concerns. One could still confuse war with everyday living..."{{2|2}}

"It seems a strange thing to recall these events, like waking to find I had narrowly missed a fatal fall in the darkness. Whenever I think back, I'm filled with wonder that I still live, and horror that I still travel by night."{{2|4}}

"One [[sorcerer]], the ancients say, is worth a thousand warriors in battle and ten thousand sinners in Hell."{{2|6}}

"If one doubts that passion and unreason govern the fate of nations, one need only look to meetings between the Great. Kings and emperors are unused to treating with equals, and are often excessively relieved or repelled as a result. The [[Nilnamesh]]i have a saying, "When princes meet, they find either brothers or themselves", which is to say, either peace or war.{{2|9}}

"The arrogance of the Inrithi waxed bright in the days following [[Anwurat]]. Though the sober-minded demanded they press the attack, the great majority clamored for respite. They though the Fanim doomed, just as they thought them doomed after [[Mengedda]]. But while the Men of the Tusk tarried the Padirajah plotted. He would make the world his shield."{{2|16}}

"For men, no circle is ever closed. We walk ever in spirals."{{2|23}}

"My heart shrivels even as my intellect bristles. Reasons -- I find myself desperate for reasons. Sometimes I think every word written is written for shame."{{3|1}}

"To merely recall the [[Apocalypse]] is to have survived it. This is what makes ''[[The Sagas]]'', for all their cramped beauty, so monstrous. Despite their presentations, the poets who authored them do not tremble, even less do they grieve. They celebrate."{{3|8}}

"Some say I learned dread knowledge that night. But of this, as with so many other matters, I cannot write for fear of summary execution."{{3|14}}

"Ajencis, in the end, argued that ignorance was the only absolute. According to [[Parcis]], he would tell his students that he knew only that he knew more than when he was an infant. This comparative assertion was the only nail, he would say, to which one could tie the carpenter-string of knowledge. This has come down to us as the famed "Ajencian Nail", and it is the only thing that prevented the Great [[Kyranean]] from falling into the tail-chasing scepticism of [[Nirsolfa]], or the embarrassing dogmatism of well-nigh every philosopher and theologian who ever dared scratch ink across parchment. But even this metaphor, "nail", is faulty, a result of what happens when we confuse our notation with what is noted. Like the numeral "zero" used by the Nilnameshi mathematicians to work such wonders, ignorance is the occluded frame of all discourse, the unseen circumference of our every contention. Men are forever looking for the one point, the singular fulcrum they can use to dislodge all competing claims. Ignorance does not give us this. What it provides, rather, is the possibility of comparison, the assurance that not all claims are equal. And this, Ajencis would argue, is all that we need. For so long as we admit our ignorance, we can hope to improve our claims, and so long as we can improve our claims, we can aspire to the Truth, even if only in rank approximation. And this is why I mourn my love of the Great Kyranean. For despite the pull of his wisdom, there re many things of which I am absolutely certain, things that feed the hate which drives this very quill."{{3|17}}

'''Surmante Xatantius I''' was the most warlike of the Surmante Emperors of [[Nansur]].

Xatantius enlarged the Nansur Empire to its greatest extent, pacifying the [[Norsirai]] tribes of the [[Cepalor]] and for a time even managing to hold the far southern city of [[Invishi]] (though he failed to entirely subdue the [[Nilnamesh]]i countryside). Despite his military successes, his continual wars exhausted both the Nansur people and the Imperial Treasury, inadvertently laying the groundwork for the disastrous wars against the [[Kian]]ene following his death.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Xatantius I'&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fifth Battle of Mengedda''' was the first decisive battle fought between the [[Holy War|First Holy War]] and the [[Kian]]ene, in 4111.

Plagued with organizational problems and dissension under its commanders, the First Holy War, under the nominal command of Prince [[Coithus Saubon]], was caught by [[Skauras ab Nalajan]] and his Kianene host on the [[Mengedda Plains]] with only half of its available strength. From morning to late afternoon, the [[Inrithi]] managed to beat back innumerable Kianene charges. When the remainder of the First Holy War arrived on the [[Fanim]] flank, the will of the Kianene broke and they were routed.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Battle of Mengedda, the Fifth’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">'''Mysunsai''', "The Bond of Three", is a self-proclaimed "mercenary [[School]]", which sells its sorcerous services across the [[Three Seas]].

Perhaps the largest of the [[Anagogic]] Schools, though far from the most powerful, the Mysunsai are a commercial result of the 3804 defensive amalgamation of three minor Schools during the [[Scholastic Wars]]: the [[Mikka Council]] from [[Cironj]], the [[Oaranat]] from [[Nilnamesh]], and the ([[Cengemis|Cengemic]]) [[Nilitar Compact]] from [[Ce Tydonn]]. Under the terms of the infamous Psailian Concession during the Scholastic Wars, the Mysunsai assisted the [[Inrithi]] in their [[Ainon]]i campaigns, an act for which the School was never forgiven, though it did much to confirm the School's exclusive commercial interests to its customers&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 468, 'Mysunsai'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mysunsai Schoolmen have a reputation for being lesser sorcerers.

The Saik, or Imperial Saik as they are often called, are the institutional descendants of the [[Saka]], the notorious state-sanctioned School of Imperial [[Cenei]], who for a thousand years dominated the [[Three Seas]] under the aegis of the Aspect-Emperors. Though still considered a Major School, the Saik have dwindled in strength, their resources limited by Nansur's losses and their numbers diminished by continual skirmish with the [[Cishaurim]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 480, 'Saik'&lt;/ref&gt;.

They are also known as "Sorcerers of the Sun"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 489, 'Sorcerers of the Sun'&lt;/ref&gt;.

They wear black and gold robes.

Raised by [[Surmante Xatantius I]] in 3684, it was originally called “Insarum,” until it fell to the [[Fanim]] in 3839, who called it Il’huda, “the Bulwark.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Citadel of the Dog’&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortress has round towers, massive barbicans, and offset inner and outer gates. The defenses are tiered, so that each concentric ring overshadows the next. The outer walls are shelled in glossy black basalt. It gained the nickname “Citadel of the Dog” because the towering central keep vaguely resembles a dog curled about his master’s leg.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Daimos,''' also known as noömancy, is the sorcery of summoning and enslaving agencies from the [[Outside]], namely, [[Ciphrang]].

For both political and pragmatic reasons, many [[The Schools|Schools]] forbid its practice. Some esoteric scholars claim that Daimotic sorcerers condemn themselves to eternal torment at the hands of their erstwhile slaves when they die.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Daimos’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daimotic Summoners==
* [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]
* [[Heramari Iyokus]]

==Trivia==
* The branches of sorcery all take their names from Greek words. “Daimos” comes from the Greek word “Δαιμος,” meaning “Demons.”

'''Ciphrang''' are incorporeal agencies from the [[Outside]], of lesser power than the [[Gods]], that can be summoned through [[Daimos|Daimotic]] [[sorcery]]. They are commonly known as demons.

As they are divine agencies, manifesting in the world and taking a physical shape is a deeply painful experience to them. When forcibly summoned into the physical realm by Daimotic sorcerers, they are bound by their summoner’s will until he chooses to release them back into the Outside.

Ciphrang are commonly divided into ranks based on their power. These include Debiles and Potents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known Ciphrang==
* [[Ankaryotis]]
* [[Hagazioz]]
* [[Hish]]
* [[Kakaliol]]
* [[Puskarat]]
* [[Setmahaga]]
* [[Sohorat]]
* [[Urskrux]]
* [[Zioz]]

'''Ikurei Sorius I''' was the first of the long line of shrewd yet defensive Ikurei emperors of [[Nansur]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Ikurei Dynasty'&lt;/ref&gt;

A former Exalt-General, Sorius came to power as the result of a coup brought about by the turmoil following the loss of [[Shigek]] to the [[Kian]]ene in 3933. He reorganized both the Imperial Army and the empire, changes that allowed him and his descendants to defeat no fewer than three full-scale [[Fanim]] invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Nansur Empire'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">The '''Indara-Kishauri''' are the “tribe” of the [[Cishaurim]].

The “Indara” refer, in the [[Kian]]ene tradition, to the “tribe of water-bearers,” a legendary band that supposedly wandered the dunes dispensing water and mercy to the faithful. The designation is critical (according to the ''[[kipfa’aifan]],'' it saved [[Fane]]’s life), given the importance of tribal affiliation in desert Kianene society.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Indara-Kishauri’&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastoralists of the Carathay desert are unique in possessing a grammatical distinction between us and them, self and other, one which can only be captured in Sheyic as “us-them.” The stories of the Indara-Kishauri ranging from their mythical home of Udavant hidden somewhere in the lifeless heart of the Great Salt personify this distinction for the Kianene in particular, who referred to their shamanistic Kiunnat priests as such. These formed the trans-tribal basis for the spread of Fanimry, as well as the sudden transformation of a fractious, internecine tribal people into a cohesive, empire-building nation. By characterizing his miraculous powers as “water” and himself as a divine “water-bearer,” Fane managed to seize high ground built into the very structure of Kianene language.

I have scaled the ramparts of great Golgotterath, watched the hearts of High Kings break for fury.|Cet'ingira}}

'''Cet’ingira''', also known as '''Mekeritrig''' (“Traitor of Men” in Kûniüric), is an Erratic [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Siqû]] and powerful [[Qûya]] who revealed the location of the [[Incû-Holoinas|Min-Uroikas]] to the [[the Schools|School]] of [[Mangaecca]] in 777, and who would become a ranking member of the [[Consult]] during the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Mekeritrig’&lt;/ref&gt;

== What Came Before ==
Cet’ingira was sent on an expedition together with two [[Ishroi]] into the depths of the Incû-Holoinas by [[Nil’giccas]] following the end of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]. They beheld the Inverse Fire. The two Ishroi, [[Misariccas]] and [[Runidil]], were driven to madness by the sight of it, while Cet’ingira appeared able to keep his wits. Upon returning, Cet’ingira advised the King to have the other two killed. Unknown to the others, Cet'ingira had also been affected, and was now wholly convinced of Damnation and the Inchoroi's mission to close the world to the Outside.&lt;ref&gt;[[The False Sun]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries, Cet'ingira disguised his true intentions. It was he who advised Nil'giccas to begin the [[Nonman Tutelage]] of the Men - ostensibly to teach the Nonmen's knowledge to the younger race, but in reality so that he could secretly pass on the Inchoroi's revelation.

== The Darkness That Comes Before ==
Anâsurimbor Kellhus meets Cet'ingira on his long way south in the ruins of a Nonman fortress after killing a pack of Sranc. Cet'ingira, amused, eyes the many dead Sranc around Kellhus and notes that among those killed by him, one was his Eljû, a Sranc he and other Nonmen used as a "book". He then attacks after Kellhus prods him with various questions, and he senses that Kellhus has the same blood as one of the many skinned faces he uses as a part of his cloak. To his surprise, Kellhus outmatches him in their sword fight, but Cet'ingira overpowers him by using sorcery and forces the Dûnyain to flee.

== The Thousandfold Thought ==
Drusas Achamian sees Cet'ingira in a Seswatha's dream relieved by Nautzera. The Evil Siqû interrogates the ancient hero in the recently fallen Dagliash, but is broken himself and weeps at his own degradation and the pain he causes Seswatha, who he viewed, in a way, his child. Achamian sees that completely covering the walls of Dagliash are hundreds upon hundreds of twitching human forms, all held up by immense nails driven through their torsos and groins.

== The Unholy Consult ==
At the battle of Golgotterath, Anâsurimbor Kellhus tears off his head. Thus died the Evil Siqû, and his soul was cast down to Hell, to suffer eternally.

'''Anasûrimbor''' '''Nau-Cayûti''' (“Blessed Son” in Ûmeritic) officially was the youngest son of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]] and his wife [[Suriala]]. But perhaps he was a bastard child of [[Seswatha]] and the Queen.

Nau-Cayûti was famed for his heroism and martial brilliance during the dark days after the fall of [[Aörsi]] (2136), when the nation of [[Kûniüri]] stood alone against the menace of the [[Consult]]. He rose to fame in the [[Battle of Ossirish]], where he routed the Consult forces and personally killed the dragon [[Tanhafut|Tanhafut the Red]]. After this, he became popularly known as ''Murswagga,'' the Dragonslayer. Many of his exploits are recounted in ''[[The Sagas]].''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Nau-Cayûti’&lt;/ref&gt;

His last great deed was infiltrating [[Golgotterath]] itself, together with his mentor and possible father Seswatha, where they stole the mysterious [[Heron Spear]]. This daring exploit was motivated by Nau-Cayûti’s desperate desire to rescue his favorite concubine, [[Aulisi]]. [[Mandate]] commentators dispute the account found in ''The Sagas,'' where they successfully return with both Aulisi and the Heron Spear, claiming that Aulisi was never found.

Nau-Cayûti died shortly after the theft of the Heron Spear. According to ''The Sagas,'' he was murdered with poison by his wife, [[Iëva]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Apocalypse’&lt;/ref&gt;

However, visions into the past, received by [[Drusas Achamian]] through [[Seswatha’s Dreams]], suggested that the poison merely paralyzed him. Iëva was in reality working for the Consult, and made sure to bury her husband alive rather than burning him.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; Nau-Cayûti was then exhumed from his grave by [[Aurang]] and taken as a prisoner to Golgotterath. Nau-Cayuti later embraced the Consult's vision after viewing the Inverse Fire; nonetheless the Consult used his soul to create the No-God by placing him in the Carapace. &lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called “script law” of [[Iothiah]] forced, on punishment of death, all visitors bearing books to surrender them for copying and inclusion in the Library. Though the Sareöts were massacred when [[Shigek]] fell to the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] in 3933, Padirajah [[Fan’oukarji III]] spared the Library when he found it contained maps useful for his [[Dagger Jihad|Jihad]], thinking it the will of the [[Solitary God]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Sareotic Library’&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surmante Skilura II''', also called "the Mad", was the most cruel of the Surmante Emperors of [[Nansur]], whose deranged antics led to the Granary Revolts of 3668 and the accension of [[Surmante Xatantius I]] to the Mantle.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Skilura II'&lt;/ref&gt;

Skilura is said to have kept a bowl of molten gold at his side, to fling into the faces of those who displeased him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="544">'''''Nimil''''' is a rare metal used in by [[Nonmen]] in their weapons and armor, also known as "Nonman steel". It is forged in the [[sorcery|sorcerous]] furnaces of [[Ishterebinth]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 471, 'nimil'&lt;/ref&gt;. In ancient times, ''nimil'' was mined in the lowest depths of [[Cil-Aujas]], where the Nonmen used up the lives of several thousand slaves in their efforts to find the metal.

Weapons of ''nimil ''are sharper and stronger than any steel blades forged by Men.

'''Geshrunni''' is a Shield-Captain of the [[Javreh]], slain in [[carythusal]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Geshrunni'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Geshrunni has a hawkish soldier's face, a beared pleated into what look like black leather straps, and tanned arms. He has a line of Ainoni pictograms tattooed from his shoulder to his wrist.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

[[Drusas Achamian]] befriends Geshrunni in an attempt to use him as an informant to learn about the [[Scarlet Spires]]. Geshrunni quickly identifies him as a [[Mandate]] Schoolman, and uses a [[Chorae]] to force Achamian to confess to being a spy. However, he does not kill Achamian, instead taking a small measure of vengeance against his cruel Scarlet Spire masters by giving away valuable information regarding the assassination of [[Sasheoka]] ten years previously.

Shortly after the meeting, Geshrunni is killed by a [[skin-spy]] that had been observing Achamian.

After the meeting, he meets with Polchias Simas and reveals that they had already known that the Fanim will be the targets of the Holy War and expresses some regret for lying to Achamian. Simas assures him that lying was necessary to motivate Achamian, as they both find him to be weak. During the meeting, Nautzera is annoyed by Simas's friendly persona, believing it to be false.

'''Polchias Simas''' is [[Drusas Achamian]]'s old teacher and a member of the Quorum, the ruling council of the [[School]] of [[Mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Simas, Polchias'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Simas has white hair and a snow-white beard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
With his mild personality, Simas is described as "water to [[Seidru Nautzera|Nautzera's]] fire." During the Quorum meeting at which Achamian is sent on his mission to discover the target of Maithanet's Holy War, Simas reveals that he has told the Quorum about Achamian's former student [[Paro Inrau]], which Achamian feels is a great betrayal.

After the Quorum meeting, Simas meets with Nautzera and discusses how they already know that the Fanim will be the true targets the Holy War. They lied to Achamian because they feel that he is weak and needed the motivation. During a private conversation, Nautzera expresses doubts about the strategy, but Simas assures him that it was necessary. Nautzera becomes annoyed by Simas's mild personalty, believing that it is an act.

At some unknown point, Simas is killed and replaced by a [[skin-spy]]. Its identity is exposed by [[Maithanet]] during a visit to [[Atyersus]]. The skin-spy who impersonates him is the only skin-spy ever known to be capable of [[sorcery]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paro Inrau''' is a former student of [[Drusas Achamian]], slain in [[Sumna]].{{EG|Inrau, Paro}}

==Appearance==
Inrau is dark-haired, slender, and clean-shaven. He has large brown eyes and feminine lips.{{1|4}}

==Story==
===''What Came Before''===
Achamian took on Inrau as a student, training him to become a member of the [[Mandate]]; however, Inrau decided not to join the Mandate and to become a [[Shrial Priest]] of the [[Thousand Temples]] instead. Defection from the Mandate is normally punished by death, but Achamian arranged for Inrau’s escape.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Achamian is instructed by his superiors to use Inrau as an informant to learn more about [[Maithanet]] and his [[Holy War]]. Shortly after agreeing to help Achamian, Inrau is confronted by two [[skin-spies]], [[Mujonish]] and [[Cutias Sarcellus]], and a [[Consult]] [[Synthese]]. Inrau destroys Mujonish, but realizes he is outmatched by the Synthese, and jumps to his death rather than risk giving up valuable information when it threatens him with the [[Agonies]].

{{stub}}

'''Maithanet''' is the Shriah of the [[Thousand Temples]], and primary instigator of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Maithanet'&lt;/ref&gt;

His name means "instruction".&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Maithanet has blue eyes and blonde hair, though he dyed it black when he first took the office of Shriah.

==Skills==

Maithanet recieved [[Dûnyain]] training allowing him to effortlessly read peoples' emotions and manipulate them. His training allows him to identify [[skin-spies]] by sight.

He is one of the [[the Few|Few]], but never studied [[sorcery]].

==Story==

===What Came Before===
Maithanet is a son of [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]], making him [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]]'s half-brother.

According to the Mandate, Maithanet seemed to seize the position of Shriah almost out of nowhere. He quickly thwarted three separate plans to assassinate him. He also identified and purged a number of spies from rival factions.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

Maithanet's plan to call a Holy War becomes known to the other factions, including the Mandate, who are not sure whether the target will be Sorcerers or the Fanim. They send Achamian to Sumna to learn the truth. Maithanet ultimately declares his Holy War against the [[Fanim]], calling upon all Inrithi to join in a massive invasion of [[Kian]] to retake the holy city of [[Shimeh]].

[[File:Chorae by spiralhorizon-d6ps51q.png|thumb|300px]]
Forbidden from practicing their art under [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], they were seduced by the [[Inchoroi]], whose loss of the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]] had been largely due to the power of Qûya. The practicioners of the Aporos created for their masters the first [[Chorae]], which rendered their bearers immune to magic and killed Qûya on touch.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uroborian Circle]] is thought to also function on aporetic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Uroborian Circle’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* The branches of sorcery all take their names from Greek words. “Aporos” comes from the Greek word “Άπορος,” meaning “Destitute.”

'''Nersei Calmemunis''' is the Palatine of the [[Conriya]]n province of [[Kanampurea]], and nominal leader of the [[Vulgar Holy War]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Calmemunis, Nersei'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Calmemunis is tall and broad of shoulder. His mouth is somewhat small. He wears a beard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==

Calmemunis is arrogant, headstrong, and stupid.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===What Came Before===

Calmemunis fought in the [[Battle of Paremti]] under his cousin [[Nersei Proyas]], who had him whipped for impiety. Calmemunis and his men brought charges against him, both to the ecclesiastical courts and to the King. Proyas, humbled after a severe chatising from [[Krijates Xinemus]], offered to compensate Calmemunis lash for lash. Calmemunis accepted, whipping Proyas before the eyes of the King and court, not realizing until afterwards that in doing so he lost the high ground and gained the appearance of a petty, resentful oaf. Calmemunis claimed that Proyas had tricked him, and never forgave his cousin for this loss of honor.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

Calmemunis is the first of the great [[Inrithi]] nobles to reach the [[Nansur Empire]] and join the [[Holy War]]. Believing the threat of the [[Fanim]] to be overstated, and worried that the glory of presiding over the Holy War's victory over them will be taken from him if he waits for more high-ranking nobles to arrive, Calmemunis leads the Vulgar Holy War to battle without waiting for reinforcements. He, and all who follow him, are subsequently massacred at the [[Fourth Battle of Mengedda]].

'''Skeaös''' is the Prime Counsel to [[Ikurei Xerius III]], having served in that capacity for thirty years.{{1|18}}

At some point, Skeaös was killed and replaced by a [[skin-spy]].

== Appearance and Personality ==
Skeaös is extremely old, with a shriveled and prune-like appearance, sunken cheeks and white hair. He has a cringing, obsequious manner around his superiors in contrast to his bold administrative tactics.

==Story==

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

Skeaös counsels  Xerius's plans to seize control of the Holy War, and several others suspect that much of Xerius's daring plan was authored by Skeaös. During Xerius's meeting with Skauras, old rivals Skeaös and [[Cememketri]] get into an argument, which Xerius sees as a colossal embarrassment.

While walking up to the Andiamine Heights, Conphas notes that Skeaös has the endurance of a monkey for all his age. During their conversation, Skeaös claims that Xerius wanted to exclude Conphas from a meeting with the Scarlet Spires, which Conphas identifies as a lie. After some pressing, Skeaös admits that he sees the extermination of the [[Vulgar Holy War]] as a sin and fears for his soul. Conphas suspects that the lie was meant to put Conphas at odds with Xerius and rein the emperor in.

When [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] comes for an audience with Xerius, he notices that Skeaös's face is false. Xerius, who is intensely paranoid, notices Kellhus's scrutiny of Skeaös and has him detained as a possible spy. Skeaös demonstrates superhuman ability in killing several of the men who attempt to apprehend him.

Xerius has [[Cememketri]] of the Imperial Saik and Skalateas of the Mysunsai to check Skeaös for the Mark of sorcery. Although Skeaös demonstrates superhuman immunity to pain under torture, the two grandmasters insist that they see no mark. Distrusting the Imperial Saik and doubting the Mysunsai's skill, Xerius asks [[Drusas Achamian]] for his opinion.

Upon seeing the [[Mandate]] Schoolman, Skeaös taunts him about the [[Consult]], referring to him as "[[Seswatha|Chigra]]."  With superhuman strength, he breaks free, kills several people in the attendance and reveals himself to be a [[skin-spy]]. The Imperial Saik sorcerer blasts him, over Achamian's protests, but the skin-spy is still alive. He attempts to crush the skull of Achamian with his face limbs, but Conphas chops his head off.

'''Xunnurit''' is the [[Scylvendi]] chieftain of the [[Akkunihor]] tribe, infamous for leading the Scylvendi to defeat at the [[Battle of Kiyuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Xunnurit'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Xunnurit is missing two fingers on his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

Xunnurit is elected King-of-Tribes for the Battle of Kiyuth. He engages in a verbal battle with [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] over the host's tactics. Cnaiur urges that the host practice caution and bide its time to attack at a moment and place of their choosing. Xunnurit counters that they should strike quickly and decisively so that they can return home to bring their herds to summer pasture before the droughts begin.

Xunnurit's skillful rhetoric and sly mockery of Cnaiur's past wins the support of the other chieftains, and he leads the Scylvendi in an immediate and all-out attack. The battle results in a disastrous defeat for the Scylvendi.

After the battle, he is taken prisoner by [[Ikurei Conphas]] and brought back to [[Momemn]] in chains. There, he is tortured, mutilated and displayed as a symbol of Nansur triumph.

'''Ikurei Conphas''' is the nephew of Emperor [[Ikurei Xerius III]] and heir apparent to the Imperial Mantle.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Conphas, Ikurei’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Conphas is exceptionally conceited, to the point he becomes convinced of his own divinity.

==Story==
===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Conphas is charged with attacking the [[Scylvendi]] to ensure that the Nansur-Scylvendi border is safe during the [[Holy War]]. Conphas studies military history and realizes that their tactics can be predicted. Through a number of cunning maneuvers, he baits the Scylvendi horde into attacking and annihilates their [[Chorae]]-archers, allowing the [[Imperial Saik]] to emerge and obliterate the Scylvendi host.

Upon arriving back at the [[Andiamine Heights]] for his triumph, he impulsively ponders  assassinating his uncle Xerius, but backs down when he learns that the soldiers lining the parade ground are Xerius's men, not his own.

When Xerius's plans to bend the [[Great Names]] into signing his [[indenture]] hit a rough patch, he adds Conphas's proven military genius as an incentive to sign. In the camps of the arriving Holy War at [[Momemn]], Conphas meets with [[Nersei Proyas]] and humiliates the prince in their verbal jousting.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
[[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] expels Conphas from [[Caraskand]], ordering him to return to [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] and sending [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] to watch over him. Cnaiür, who has been secret orders to assassinate Conphas, rapes him but does not kill him. Conphas subsequently escapes [[Joktha]], joins with reinforcements from Nansur, and attacks the city from without, killing all those loyal to Kellhus save for Cnaiür. Cnaiür is imprisoned, but promptly escapes with the aid of a [[skin-spies|skin-spy]] impersonating [[Biaxi Sompas]].

Upon receiving news of the death of Xerius, Conphas proclaims himself Emperor of Nansur.

Conphas joins the battle in defense of [[Shimeh]], but his forces are decimated by [[Drusas Achamian]], and he is subsequently slain by [[Coithus Saubon]] as his Galeoth forces arrive.

'''Ikurei Xerius III''' was the Emperor of [[Nansur]] from 4081 until his assassination in 4112 ([[Year-of-the-Tusk]]). He is infamous for attempting to usurp the [[Holy War]] to his own ends using his Imperial [[Indenture]].

==Appearance and personality==
Xerius is paranoid, superstitious and excessively proud of himself—arrogant to the point of thinking himself divine.{{1|5}}{{1|8}}

==Story==
==='''''The Darkness That Comes Before'''''===
Ikurei Xerius III hatches an intricate plot to secure any lands conquered by the Holy War for the Nansur Empire. Much of what was then called heathen [[Kian]] once belonged to the Nansur, and recovering the Empire’s lost provinces is Xerius’s most fervent desire. Since the Holy War gathers in the Nansur Empire, it can march only if provisioned by the Emperor, something he refuses to do until every leader of the Holy War signs his Indenture, a written oath to cede all lands conquered to him. The first caste-nobles to arrive repudiate the Indenture, and a stalemate ensues. As the Holy War’s numbers swell into the hundreds of thousands, however, the titular leaders of the host begin to grow restless. Since they war in the God’s name, they think themselves invincible, and as a result see little reason to share the glory with those yet to arrive. A [[Conriya]]n noble named [[Nersei Calmemunis]] comes to an accommodation with the Emperor, and convinces his fellows to sign the Imperial Indenture. Once provisioned, most of those gathered march, even though their lords and a greater part of the Holy War have yet to arrive. Because the host consists primarily of lordless rabble, it comes to be called the [[Vulgar Holy War]].

Despite [[Maithanet]]’s attempts to bring the makeshift host to heel, it continues marching southward, and passes into heathen lands, where—precisely as the Emperor had planned—the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] destroy it utterly. Xerius knows that in military terms the loss of the Vulgar Holy War is insignificant, since the rabble that largely constituted it would have proven more a liability than an advantage in battle. In political terms, however, the Vulgar Holy War’s destruction is invaluable, because it has shown Maithanet and the [[Men of the Tusk]] the true mettle of their adversary. The Fanim, as the Nansur well know, are not to be trifled with, even with the God’s favour. Only an outstanding general, Xerius claims, can assure the Holy War’s victory—a man like his nephew, [[Ikurei Conphas]], who after his recent victory over the dread [[Scylvendi]] at the [[Battle of Kiyuth]] has been hailed as the greatest tactician of his age. The leaders of the Holy War need only sign the Imperial Indenture and Conphas’s preternatural skill and insight will be theirs.

In an effort to forestall disaster Maithanet calls a Council of Great and Lesser Names, and all the leaders of the Holy War gather in the Emperor’s palace, the [[Andiamine Heights]], to make their arguments. There [[Nersei Proyas]] shocks the assembly by offering a many-scarred Scylvendi Chieftain, a veteran of past wars against the Fanim, as a surrogate for the famed Ikurei Conphas. The Scylvendi, [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]], shares hard words with both the Emperor and his nephew, and the leaders of the Holy War are impressed. The Shriah’s Envoy, however, remains undecided: the Scylvendi are as apostate as the Fanim, after all. Only the wise words of Prince Anasûrimbor Kellhus of Atrithau settle the matter. The Envoy reads the decree demanding that the Emperor, under pain of Shrial Censure, provision the Men of the Tusk. And the Holy War marches.

==='''''The Warrior Prophet'''''===
Maithanet, the Shriah of the [[Thousand Temples]] summons Xerius to the temple of [[Xothei]] in [[Momemn]]. Maithanet asks Xerius if he has sealed a pact with the Fanim to betray the Holy War before it reaches [[Shimeh]], Xerius lies and denies the accusation.{{2|9}}

==='''''The Thousandfold Thought'''''===
Xerius is killed by a [[skin-spy]] impersonating his mother, [[Ikurei Istriya]], after the two attempt to copulate. He is succeeded by his nephew Ikurei Conphas.{{3|4}}

==Story==
===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Along with [[Nersei Calmemunis]] and [[Akori Kumrezzer]], Tharschilka agrees to the [[Indenture]] so that he can be one of the leaders of the Vulgar Holy War, expecting to achieve glory with a quick victory over the [[Fanimry|Fanim]]. He is killed in the [[Fourth Battle of Mengedda]].

'''Anissi''' was the favourite wife of [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Anissi'&lt;/ref&gt;. She was half-[[Norsirai]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Story ==

=== What Came Before ===
Anissi married Cnaiür at an unknown date. They had at least one child together, a daughter named Sanathi.

=== ''The Darkness That Comes Before'' ===
Anissi is present when Cnaiür returns to the [[Utemot]] camp and kills [[Yursalka]] and his kin&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. She expresses relief at the fact he survived [[Battle of Kiyuth|Kiyuth]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

After Cnaiür finds [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]], Anissi talks to her husband about him&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;. She tells him Kellhus claimed the dead men found with him were from [[Atrithau]] and his followers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Anissi also confesses that she is as frightened of Kellhus as she is of Cnaiür himself&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Later, Cnaiür strikes Anissi after he sees her weeping during his torture of Kellhus&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. She is also present (along with Cnaiür's other wives) when the two men depart&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

According to Kellhus, Cnaiür prizes Anissi above his other wives because she is the only one to weather his torment and still love him&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. He also believes Cnaiür's interest in [[Serwë]] is due to the fact that she reminds him of Anissi&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Warrior-Prophet'' ===
As he thinks about Serwë, Cnaiür also imagines Anissi sleeping far away, holding their daughter [[Sanathi]] close&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Thousandfold Thought'' ===
Anissi appears in one of Cnaiür's nightmares&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Later Events ===
Anissi died of unknown causes in 4113&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Anissi'&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Hoga Gothyelk''' is the Earl of [[Agansanor]], and leader of the [[Ce Tydonn|Tydonni]] contingent of the [[Holy War]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Gothyelk, Hoga’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Gothyelk has a thick waist, long, iron-grey beard, a broad nose and overgrown brows.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

=== ''The Darkness That Comes Before'' ===
Gothyelk attends the meeting of the [[Great Names]] at [[Momemn]] at the start of the [[Holy War]]. He is loudly chastising his three sons also in attendance. [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] sees the love he harbors for his sons beneath the father's stern expression.

=== ''The Warrior-Prophet'' ===
Gothyelk and his Tydonni host joins Coithus Saubon's Galeoth and the Thunyeri contingent to separate from the Holy War and attack [[Gedea]]. Along the way, Gothyelk's reckless intentions infuriate the more cautious Saubon. The two men nearly come to blows, and Gothyelk detaches from Saubon's host to go his own way, with the Thunyeri following.

When Saubon arrives on the Battleplain, he eventually realizes that Gothyelk's host has been marching parallel with his own. The forces reunite and attack the Kianene together. Gothyelk is felled from his horse during the battle, but rescued by his sons.

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
Gothyelk is slain by [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]] during the battle of [[Shimeh]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Judging Eye''===
In the twenty years since the end of the Holy War, Gothyelk has come to be known as “the Martyr of Shimeh.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===

Kepfet exchanges missives and hostages with Saubon during the Holy War's siege of Caraskand. He and his compatriots' hatred for [[Imbeyan ab Imbaran]] is so great that they are willing to sacrifice Caraskand to see the Sapatishah-Governor dead. He opens one of the gates of Caraskand, allowing a group of raiders including Saubon and [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] to enter and open the Gate of Horns for the Holy War.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">The '''Cants of Calling''' are the family of [[sorcery|sorcerous]] incantations that enable communications over distance.

Though the metaphysics of these Cants is only loosely understood, all long-distance Cants of Calling seem to turn on the so-called Here Hypothesis. One can call only to slumbering souls (because they remain open to the [[Outside]]) and only to those residing someplace where the Caller has physically been. The idea is that the "Here" of the Caller can only reach a "There", or other location, that has been a "Here" sometime in the past.

The degree of similarity between [[Anagogic]] and [[Gnostic]] Cants of Calling has led many to suspect that they hold the key to unravelling the Gnosis&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 422, 'Cants of Calling'&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Known Cants==

===Ishra Discursia===

The Ishra Discursia  is the most ancient and most simple of the [[Gnostic]] Cants of Calling&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 6, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;.

It consists of two strings in the Gilcûnya tongue, one utteral and the other inutteral, which must be spoken and thought simultaneously.

The utteral is, ''"Iratisrineis lo ocoimenein loroi hapara..."'' &lt;br&gt;
The inutteral is, ''"Li lijineriera cui ashiritein hejaroit..."''

Typically these include the so-called Cants of Torment (the [[Agonies]]), though not always. An insidious aspect of these Cants is that their subject often has no way of distinguishing [[sorcery|sorcerously]] compelled thoughts from his own thoughts. This has spawned a whole literature on the very notion of "will". If the compelled soul feels every bit as uncompelled as the free soul, then how can anyone truly know himself to be free?&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 422, 'Cants of Compulsion'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Though weaker in the so-called Middle North, the [[Inrithi]] caste system is one of the central institutions of [[Three Seas]] society. In a technical sense, there almost as many castes as there are occupations, but in practice they fall into roughly four different groups: the suthenti or laboring castes (caste-menial); the momurai or transactional castes (caste-apparati); the nahat or priestly castes (caste-priest); and the kijneta or warrior castes (caste-noble).

Elaborate [[jnan]]ic protocols supposedly govern all interactions within and between castes to ensure the observances of various privileges and obligations, as well as to minimize ritual pollution, but in practical terms they are rarely adhered to unless in the pursuit of advantage&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 423, 'castes'&lt;/ref&gt;.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="905">'''Jnan''' is an informal code of manner and speech understood by many to be a "war of word and sentiment".

Adeptness at jnan is understood, particularly by the more refined subcultures of the [[Three Seas]], to be the key determinant of status among individuals who are otherwise of equal caste of station. Given that the [[God]] is believed to be manifested in the movement of history, and history is determined primarily by the disparate statuses of men, for many jnan is understood as a sacred and not simply an instrumental enterprise. Many others, however, especially the [[Norsirai]] of the Three Seas, regard jnan with contempt, as a "mere game". Jnanic exchanges are typically characterized by concealed antagonism, the appreciation of irony and intellect, and the semblance of detached interest&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 456, 'jnan'&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Arnyalsa''' is a famed missionary priest.

He is killed by [[Galeoth]] freebooters marching south to join the [[Holy War]], who destroy seventeen villages in the course of their march. Because they leave no witnesses, their crimes are not discovered until they attempt to sell possessions looted from Arnyalsa at market in [[Sumna]]. [[Maithanet]] has the Shrial Knights kill all those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krijates Xinemus''' is the [[Conriya]]n Marshal of [[Attrempus]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Xinemus, Krijates'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Xinemus is burly, thick-bearded, and bears a striking resemblance to his friend [[Drusas Achamian]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
Xinemus was the sword tutor of [[Nersei Proyas]]. In this station, he first met Drusas Achamian, who was serving as the prince's academic tutor. In spite of Xinemus's piety, he befriended the sorcerer.

Though Xinemus loves Proyas, he became increasingly alarmed when the prince began developing a rigid and fanatical faith. After Proyas had his cousin [[Nersei Calmemunis]] whipped for impiety, Xinemus commanded him to take up a practice sword and beat the young man bloody. Proyas later decided that the beating was a lesson about his stubbornness and became slightly more flexible and humble in his behavior.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Xinemus is present when [[Nersei Calmemunis]] meets with [[Ikurei Xerius III]]. Xinemus tries to caution Calmemunis against acting too rashly, but Calmemunis ignores him. Xinemus stays in Momemn when the [[Vulgar Holy War]] departs and awaits the arrival of the rest of the other lords.

Xinemus is drinking with his subordinates when Achamian seeks him out. Some of the soldiers are not ready to accept a Schoolman in their midst, but Xinemus insists that they treat him with respect. The two old friends catch up. They next day, they play [[benjuka]]. Xinemus is a better player because he does not try to force victory, like Achamian. The pair discuss the Holy War and their thoughts on Proyas.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
Xinemus accompanies the Holy War as it marches, moving with the Conriyan host. Achamian, Kellhus, Cnaiur and Serwe share his fire, among others.

'''Krijates Iryssas''' is the young and impetuous majordomo of House Krijates, and cousin to [[Krijates Xinemus]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Iryssas, Krijates'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Iryssas has thick black hair. He has a stocky face with a square-cut beard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==
Iryssas is one of Xinemus's three main subordinates. He does not welcome [[Drusas Achamian]] to Xinemus's fire, but Xinemus insists that he treat Achamian with respect. He does, though never forgetting that Achamian, as a sorcerer, is damned.

As the Holy War begins marching, Iryssas gains a reputation for being slow-witted. His attempts to debate with [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] become a common occurrence around Xinemus's fire, to the amusement of the others.

The '''Battle of Zirkirta''' was a major battle fought between the [[Kian]]ene host of [[Hasjinnet ab Skauras]] and the [[Scylvendi]] under [[Yursut urs Muknai]] on the [[Jiünati Steppe]] in 4103.

Though their cavalry proved no match for the Scylvendi, and Hasjinnet himself was slain, the Kianene were quick in recovering, and most of the ill-fated expedition survived&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 420, 'Battle of Zirkirta'&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Serwë hil Keyalti''' is a major character in the first two novels of ''[[The Prince of Nothing]]'', becoming the first wife of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].
==Appearance==
&lt;span style="font-weight:normal;"&gt;Serwë is an extremely beautiful young woman, with blond hair.&lt;/span&gt;

==Story==

===What Came Before===

Serwë's father sold her to House Gaunum as a concubine when she was fourteen. All of the children she bore the Gaunum men were strangled at birth, and the jealous wives would mock her "blue babies." However, when the [[Holy War]] was declared, all the men of the estate left to join it. The undefended villa was then sacked by [[Scylvendi]] of the [[Munuäti]] tribes, lead by [[Panteruth urs Mutkius]], and Serwë and a number of other women were taken as slaves.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===

[[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] and Kellhus encounter and kill Panteruth. Though Cnaiür abandons the other slaves, he keeps Serwë and forces himself on her each night. When she goes to kill him in his sleep, Kellhus stops her. She quickly falls in love with Kellhus, who learns Sheyic from their conversations over the course of a few days. By day she spends all her time doting on Kellhus, but by night Cnaiür continues to force himself on her. She laments the fact that Kellhus won't kill Cnaiür and rescue her from him.

When the group comes across a boy by a river, she warns the child to run away. As Cnaiür and Kellhus give chase, Serwë wanders the wilderness until she is accosted by two [[Kidruhil]] cavalrymen. One attempts to rape her, but Cnaiur appears and kills the lookout. Serwë stabs the other in the neck. Cnaiür cuts a [[swazond]] into her forearm for killing the man.

While fleeing from a detachment of the Kidruhil, Serwë has difficulty keeping pace with Kellhus and Cnaiür. The Scylvendi recommends abandoning her, but Kellhus refuses. Serwë is solely Kellhus's companion. She falls asleep with her head on Kellhus's lap as Kellhus speaks with Achamian for the first time.

In the camp of the Holy War, she has more prestige because she is the concubine of Kellhus, a respected man of rank. She still laments the fact that Kellhus will not rescue her from Cnaiür. She interrupts Kellhus while he is studying holy texts, and he tells her that she has worth, which causes her to break down in sobs. The pair have sex, and Serwë makes a point of letting Cnaiür see and hear the passion she has for Kellhus rather than him.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
In [[Caraskand]], Serwë gives birth to the infant [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II|Moënghus]]. Following the Great Names' denouncement of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] as a False Prophet, Serwë is executed by a [[Skin-spy|Skin-Spy]] impersonating [[Cutias Sarcellus|Sarcellus]]. Her naked corpse is bound to Kellhus and the two are lashed to a circumfix and hung from a [[Umiaki|great tree]] to die of exposure. Kellhus miraculously survives this ordeal and standing before the exultant masses, he reaches into his own chest and brandishes "Serwë’s burning heart".

Proyas was a student of [[Drusas Achamian]] in his youth. The two shared a close bond, and Achamian loved him, but Proyas turned away from Achamian after becoming a devout follower of Inrithism. [[Krijates Xinemus|Xinemus]] was his swordsmanship tutor.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Proyas is a devoted follower of Maithanet, and he is present beside Maithanet as the Shriah announces the target of the [[Holy War]].

He recognizes Achamian when the Mandate sorcerer is crowd-surfed to Maithanet's side. He is outraged by the blasphemy in spite of his former devotion to Achamian. Afterwards, Maithanet brings him to witness the [[Tusk]] for the first time.

Proyas joins the Holy War as one of its Great Names. leading his contingent of Conriyans. Upon first meeting Ikurei Conphas, the two men develop an instant rivalry and hatred for each other.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
Proyas marches with the Holy War leading his Conriyans. When [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] convinces [[Coithus Saubon]] to separate from the rest of the Holy War and take his [[Galeoth]] host to attack [[Gedea]] , Proyas angrily confronts Kellhus at Xinemus's fire. Onlookers are shocked by Proyas's disrespectful treatment of Kellhus. Before leaving in a huff, Proyas accuses Kellhus of dooming the Holy War.

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===

===''The Judging Eye''===

Proyas is King of Conriya and one of the Exalt-Generals of the Great Ordeal.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
He is deeply hurt and puzzled when Kellhus confesses he is not a true prophet but is just a mad man. While he is experiencing emotional turmoil from this revelation, Kellhus drugs both their wine with chanv and has brutal sex with Proyas.

Later he seeks out [[Coithus Saubon]] and in tears confesses the forced sodomy and shares Kellhus's confession.  Proyas realizes his buggering may be a test as much for Saubon as for himself. Saubon convinces him that Kellhus is testing them but states they must continue to act even in they lose faith as Kellhus will lead them to victory at [[Golgotterath]]. {{6|4}}

At [[Dagliash]], his heart is battered by the proportion of the slaughter of [[Sranc]]. He wonders why he doesn't share in the joy of the others.{{6|13}}

After the explosion of the mountain, Kellhus comes to Proyas and takes him to a mountain top and explains the great and tragic victory that has polluted the land. Kellhus explains that Saubon is dead and as lone Exalt General Proyas must rally the remaining Ordeal host and go North. He charged him with keeping everyone away from the polluted land and he must cull the sick suffering from seeming radiation poisoning. Kellhus prepares him that he is the only one who can lead and make decisions that no Believer can saying "''Something'' must eaten."{{6|15}}

'''Coithus Saubon''' is the seventh son of King [[Coithus Eryeat]] of [[Galeoth]] and titular leader of the Galeoth contingent of the [[Holy War]].{{EG|Saubon, Coithus}}

==Appearance==
Saubon is strong-jawed and bard-handsome. He has short-cropped, reddish-blond hair. He is not quite as tall as [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], but stockier.
==Personality==
Saubon is highly insecure; he is obsessed with what other people think of him.{{1|17}}

==Story==

=== ''What came before'' ===
Saubon commanded the army his father sent against the [[Nansur]]ium several years prior to the [[Holy War]]. He managed several success until [[Ikurei Conphas]] was appointed Exalt-General, at which time Conphas defeated and humiliated him.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Galeoth troops under Coithus Saubon raid and cut down the inhabitants of a village near [[Pasna]] in retaliation for the [[Ikurei Xerius III|Emperor's]] refusal to provision the Holy War.{{1|15}}

When the [[Great Names]] gather before the Emperor to settle the issue of who will lead the host of the Holy War, Saubon sides with [[Nersei Proyas]] in choosing the [[Scylvendi]] [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] over Ikurei Conphas.{{1|17}}
===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
Saubon seeks [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus | Kellhus']] council about whether to march on [[Gedea]] or wait for the [[High Ainon | Ainoni]] host and the [[Scarlet Spires]]. Kellhus tells him to march and that the [[Anagkë | Whore]] will be kind to him so long as the [[Shrial Knights]] are punished.{{2|4}}

Saubon splits from the rest of Holy War along with [[Hoga Gothyelk]]'s [[Tydonni]], the [[Thunyeri]], and the Shrial Knights. Gothyelk's recklessness soon enfuriates Saubon, and the two men nearly come to blows. The Tydonni and Thunyeri follow Gothyelk as he splits from Saubon's host.

As Saubon draws near Gedea, he laments that his forces are outnumbered and poorly prepared for the battle ahead. He inwardly rails that no one knows him and curses the various circumstances that led him to this moment. He starts to doubt Kellhus's legitimacy and wonders at the Dunyain's message to "punish" the Shrial Knights. He asks his groom [[Kussalt]] about how sacrifice is perceived in [[The Tractate]] , but is offended by Kussalt's blunt response.

Saubon eventually realizes that Gothyelk's men are close by, and the Kianene are trying to prevent them from joining forces. Saubon and Gothyelk reunite and attack the Kianene at Gedea in the [[Fifth Battle of Mengedda]]. Saubon then defeats the [[Fanim]] host just as Kellhus predicted.{{2|6}}

When the Holy War reaches [[Caraskand]], Saubon asks Proyas to support his bid to become King of Caraskand in case he delivers the city to the [[Inrithi]]. The Holy War sacks the city and Saubon becomes the titular King of Caraskand.{{2|21}}{{2|24}}
===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
The Holy War departs from Caraskand, but Saubon, as King, stays behind.{{3|3}}
===''The Judging Eye''===
Coithos Saubon leads the Great Ordeal as one of its two Exalt-Generals.{{4|1}}
===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
At the Eleventh Council of Potentates, Anasûrimbor Kellhus declares the breaking of the Great Ordeal and King Saubon is charged with leading the [[Ketyai]] of the West.{{5|2}}

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
As one of the Exalt Generals, Saubon meets often with Anasûrimbor Kellhus alone like Proyas. Saubon counsels Proyas as he lost certainty in the righteousness of Anasûrimbor Kellhus as a holy prophet to not despair that yes, the great ordeal is just a calculation to the Dunyain and he is testing them, preparing them for a crisis. That everything is theatre but to trust in Kellhus's power and intellect to lead them to victory. Saubon was extremely disturbed to learn of the buggering and that Kellhus admitted he was mad. It seemed to both Saubon and Proyas that this was Saubon's test since as a Galeoth, they abhor sodomy. Saubon blames it on eating the [[Sranc]] meat and states they must continue to act even without belief.{{6|4}}

Saubon leads the Company of the Raft to protect Kellhus at [[Dagliash]] from the Horde. When he sees the overwhelming Sranc and enemies, he fathoms the enormity of the gift of death. He then realizes he does believe in the [[The Aspect-Emperor|Holy Aspect-Emperor]] and implores his men to praise him as they are overwhelmed on the tower at Kurwachal.{{6|13}}

'''Coithus Athjeäri''' is the [[Galeoth]] Earl of [[Gaenri]], and nephew to [[Coithus Saubon]].{{EG|Athjeäri, Coithus}} Considered the eyes of the Holy War,{{3|11}} he would ride out ahead with his men and report back against the [[Fanimry|Fanim]].

== The Thousandfold Thought ==
As the Holy War was slowly approaching [[Shimeh]], [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]] took to the field with his [[Coyauri]] and hand-pick Grandees to hunt down that who they called Hurall’arkeet. [[Cinganjehoi ab Sakjal]] was ordered to ride with his [[Eumarna]]ns south in an attempt to try and intercept and ambush Athjeäri and his raiding forces.

=== The Battle at Madas ===
Lying in ambush with his forces, Cinganjehoi engaged the Gaenri. Though outnumbered 10 to 1 they met Cinganjehoi’s men in battle. During the fight the son of Seleukaran Grandee stabbed Athjeäri in his face, delivering a fatal blow. At great cost his body is recovered by his men.{{3|11}}

==Story==
Kussalt is described as "grizzled," with white hair and implacable eyes. Everything about his appearance is dull and grey. He wears a dented helmet, caring nothing for his appearance, which Coithus Saubon says makes him look more impressive rather than less.

Saubon's earliest memory is getting scooped up by Kussalt after being stung by a bee. The groom has served him all his life. Kussalt joins Saubon at Mengedda, serving as an advanced scout before returning to the prince's side. Kussalt reveals that he has memorized [[The Tractate]] and tries to answer Saubon's question about sacrifice, but Saubon is unsatisifed.

'''Nin’janjin''' is the former [[Nonman]] King of [[Viri]].

Nin’janjin was the ruler of the Mansion of Viri at the time the [[Incû-Holoinas]] fell from the void. The fall of the Ark caused a natural disaster and sent up ash-clouds that darkened the skies, resulting in a famine. Nin’janjin appealed to his kinsman [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], the King of [[Siöl]], for help. But instead, Cû’jara-Cinmoi invaded and claimed Viri.

The [[Inchoroi]], emerging from the Ark, sent a secret emissary to Nin’janjin. At this point, they had “birthed mouths” and could speak Ihrimsû. They reminded Nin’janjin of Cu’jara-Cinmoi’s treachery. Seeking revenge, Nin’janjin and his warriors rose up in rebellion and joined the Inchoroi for the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], the first battle of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]. However, upon seeing the shockingly horrific nature of their would-be allies, Nin’janjin’s warriors rebelled against him and instead joined Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s forces. The Inchoroi were overpowered and lost the resulting battle. However, when they fled back into the Incû-Holoinas, they took Nin’janjin with them.

Several years later, when Cû’jara-Cinmoi had grown old and frail, Nin’janjin emerged from the Ark asking to see him. Cû’jara-Cinmoi was astonished to see that his old enemy had not aged. Nin’janjin revealed that the Inchoroi knew the secrets of immortality. He agreed to grant the Inchoroi mercy in exchange for the gift of eternal life. However, the Inchoroi medications which granted immortality were a cursed gift - they gave rise to the [[Womb Plague]] which spread rapidly and killed all the women of Cûnuroi. Only the males survived, now a race without a future.

The Nonmen went to war against the Inchoroi, seeking vengeance for their dead wives and daughters, and for the eventual extinction of their race. The [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]] raged on the plain of the [[Inniür-Shigogli]], and Nin’janjin turned against his old enemy Cû’jara-Cinmoi in the midst of the battlefield. And this time, when they fought, Nin’janjin killed him with a spear thrust.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

Nin'janjin's fate is unclear: it is known that he spoke to [[Nil'giccas]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Isal’imial]] and told him about the [[Inverse Fire]] and the [[Golden Room]] at the heart of the Incû-Holoinas, resulting in Nil'giccas sending three explorers to investigate further. When two of them returned gibbering and raving, Nil'giccas put them to death on the advice of the third, [[Cet’ingira]] and abandoned the Ark, raising the [[Barricades]] about it. It is possible that Nil'giccas had Nin'janjin executed for his treachery.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Ikurei Xerius III]] conspired to send the first half of the Holy War to its destruction, for multiple political reasons: to confirm a secret alliance with the Fanim, and to convince [[Maithanet]] and the other nobles of the Holy War of the strength of the Fanim so that they would accept his Indenture in exchange for the leadership of [[Ikurei Conphas]]. His machinations are successful, and the entire group that marches is wiped out at the [[Fourth Battle of Mengedda]].

The group was known as the Vulgar Holy War because it consisted primarily of rabble rather than professional soldiers or nobles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
* [[Akori Kumrezzer]]
* [[Gedapharus]]
* [[Heänar Tharschilka]]
* [[Istratmenni]]

Called by [[Ekyannus XIV]], the Scholastic Wars saw the near-destruction of several schools and the beginning of the [[Scarlet Spires]]' hegemony over [[High Ainon]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 482, 'Scholastic Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another consequence was the amalgamation of the [[Mikka Council]], the [[Oaranat]], and the [[Nilitar Compact]] into the [[Mysunsai]] in 3804&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, p. 468, 'Mysunsai'&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Sos-Praniura''' was a [[Nonman]] [[Qûya]]&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Since Sos-Praniura founded the Mangaecca in 684 and was still alive in 4132, yet is never mentioned as having achieved some form of immortality like Shaeönanra, it can be assumed he was in fact a Nonman and not a [[Men|Man]]. His sobriquet, "Lord-of-Poisons" is also reminiscent of those of other Nonmen, such as [[Cilcûliccas]]'s "Lord of Swans".&lt;/ref&gt; and the founder of the [[Mangaecca]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. He was said to be the greatest student of [[Gin'yursis]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Story ==

=== What Came Before ===
In 684, Sos-Praniura founded the Mangaecca, the [[School]] which would later become the [[Consult]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Mangaecca'&lt;/ref&gt;. While [[Shaeönanra]] was the Grandmaster of the Mangaecca at the time it became the Consult, Sos-Praniura eventually joined its ranks as well&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
Sos-Praniura and other Qûya working for the Consult fought the [[Swayal Compact|Swayali]], [[Mandate|Mandati]] and [[Mysunsai]] led by [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]] during the battle for [[Golgotterath]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. He was among those killed during this confrontation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

'''Skauras ab Nalajan''' is the Sapatishah-Governor of [[Shigek]] and the first principal antagonist of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]], slain at [[Anwurat]].

A veteran of many wars, he was deeply respected by both his allies and his enemies. The [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] called him Sutis Sutadra, the “Southern Jackal,” because of his Black Jackal standard.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Skauras ab Nalajan’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Skauras’s hair is white, but still thick. He has a distinguished face with a long mustache and thin braided beard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Skauras is fearless. He is a severe disciplinarian, possesses a gift for organization, and commands the respect of even those who otherwise outrank him. He also has a mischievous streak, often drugging his guest’s wine with narcotics and [[chanv]]. He likes to trick, to deceive, to show, and to prove.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Numemarius's death results from infighting among the [[Holy War]].

When the Kidruhil try to stop them, fighting breaks out between the two factions. Numemarius attempts to speak to [[Yalgrota Sranchammer]] under a flag of truce, only to be killed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
During the [[Holy War]]’s crossing of the [[Carathay Desert]], Detnammi is one of a number of raiders sent on a mission to trail the [[Khirgwi]] harassing the Ainoni and find their water supply. However, Detnammi and 459 of his followers decide to desert the main force of the Holy War and flee towards Subis to save themselves. There they are ambushed and killed, and their bodies used to pollute the waters. The circumstances surrounding his fate are only realized by the rest of the Holy War when they reach Subis themselves days later, and for his crime he is posthumously denounced and stripped of his rank and station.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ingalira''' is a [[Nonmen]] hero of [[Siöl]] mentioned in the ''[[Isûphiryas]]''.

After the fall of the [[Incû-Holoinas]], the Nonman King [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] sent Ingalira on an expedition to the Ark. He returned months later with two [[Inchoroi]] prisoners, who Cû’jara-Cinmoi had put to death.

Ingalira later fought in the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]. After the death of the Nonmen women to the Womb-Plague, Ingalira faced the Inchoroi in battle on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]]. He strangled the mighty Inchoroi [[Vshikcrû]] to death, but was himself slain later in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Cûno-Inchoroi Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaörta''' is the true name of the second [[Skin-spies|skin-spy]] to pose as [[Cutias Sarcellus]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Gaörtha’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
Gaörta is assigned to spy on [[Drusas Achamian]]. Achamian spots Gaörta following him, but Gaörta is able to escape by changing his face.

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
After the destruction of [[Maëngi]] in the [[Fifth Battle of Mengedda]], Gaörta takes over the role of Cutias Sarcellus.

As Sarcellus, Gaörta has [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] convicted as a false prophet and sentenced to death. However, [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] kills Gaörta and exposes him as a skin-spy before Kellhus dies.

==Trivia==
* Gaörta’s name is alternately spelled “Gaörta” in ''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapters 21 and 22 and “Gaörtha” in ''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' ''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 15 and the Encyclopedic Glossary.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6024">Until the [[Gates of Eärwa|Breaking of the Gates]] and the migration of the Four Nations from [[Eänna]], the [[Men]] of [[Eärwa]], called the [[Emwama]] in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', were enslaved by the [[Nonmen]] and spoke debased versions of their masters’ tongues. No trace of these languages remain. Nor does any trace of their original, pre-bondage language remain. The great Nonman history, the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'', or the “Great Pit of Years,” suggests the Emwama originally spoke the same tongue as their kin across the [[Great Kayarsus]].

This has led many to believe that [[Thoti-Eännorean]] is indeed the primeval language of all men. From it are derived all other Mannish languages.

==Languages of Nonmen==
Without doubt, the [[Nonmen]], or Cûnuroi, tongues are among the oldest in [[Eärwa]]. Some Aujic inscriptions predate the first extant example of Thoti-Eännorean, ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'', by more than five thousand years. Auja-Gilcûnni, which has yet to be deciphered, is far older still.

#*'''Aujic''':Lost tongue of the Aujan Mansions.
#*'''Ihrimsû''': Tongue of [[Injor-Niyas]].
#*'''Gilcûnya''': Tongue of the Nonmen [[Qûya]] and the [[Gnosis|Gnostic]] [[School|Schools]].
#**'''High Kunna''': Debased version of Gilcûnya, used by the [[Anagogis|Anagogic]] Schools of the [[Three Seas]].

==Other Languages==
'''Aghurzoi''' (“Cut Tongue” in Ihrimsû), is the original language of the [[Sranc]]. It is also known as '''Zohurric.'''

'''Cincûlic''' is the undeciphered tongue of the [[Inchoroi]], which the Nonmen called “Cincûl’hisa,” or the “Gasp of Many Reeds.” According to the ''Isûphiryas,'' communication between the Cûnuroi and the Inchoroi was impossible until the latter “birthed mouths” and began speaking Cûnuroi tongues.

'''Mamaradda''' is the [[Javreh]] Shield-Captain assigned to execute [[Drusas Achamian]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Mamaradda'&lt;/ref&gt;

Achamian, freed by his [[Wathi Doll]] from the [[Uroborian Circle]] preventing him from employing [[sorcery]], fights back. Mamaradda is able to resist Achamian's first attack due to holding a [[Chorae]]; however, Achamian forces him to drop it by showering him with hot coals, and then explodes his heart within his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dreams are transferred to each new member of the Mandate through the Grasping, a [[sorcery|sorcerous]] ritual involving Seswatha’s mummified heart.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Seswatha’s Heart’&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dreams are not always identical; small details may vary from time to time, and a Schoolman’s own thoughts can interfere with the Dreams’ content.

The Dreams deal only with the significant experiences of Seswatha during the Apocalypse, omitting mundane details; this has led to a saying among Mandate Schoolmen, “Seswatha does not shit.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The only known exception to this is the Dreams of [[Drusas Achamian]], which expand over time to include not only mundane events in the life of Seswatha but also events from the life of [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]], possible Seswatha’s son.

'''Nurbanu Soter''' is the King-Regent of [[High Ainon]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Soter, Nurbanu'&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly the Palatine of [[Kishyat]])&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Soter, Nurbanu’&lt;/ref&gt; and a veteran of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;. He was the leader of the Ainoni contingent in Anasûrimbor Kellhus' [[Great Ordeal]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Personality ==
Soter is renowned for his "pious cruelty" and "pragmatic brutality", particularly during the [[Unification Wars]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. He is also a bellicose man by nature&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Story==

=== ''The Warrior-Prophet'' ===
At the [[Battle of Anwurat]], the Kishyati under Soter fought off several charges from the Grandees of [[Eumarna]], purchasing time for the other Ainoni knights&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
As the [[Holy War]] marched for [[Shimeh]], Soter and his Kishyati knights ran down refugees on the [[Herotic Way]] for sport&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;. Using the Herotic Way, Soter and his Kishyati were later the first to eventually spy the black walls of [[Gerotha]] and strike up the first camp of the siege&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;.

After [[Coithus Athjeäri]] was killed, the twenty surviving Thanes and Knights of [[Gaenri]] were rescued from their pursuers by a band of Kishyati led by Soter&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the battle for [[Shimeh]], Soter led his Kishyati in a "desperate charge" from the north&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;. Later in the battle, they fought the forces led by [[Cinganjehoi ab Sakjal]], managing to drive them back and ensuring their defeat by the [[Moserothu|Moserothi]] under [[Sirpal Uranyanka]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== The Unification Wars ===
Soter distinguished himself during the Unification Wars, for which he was rewarded by being declared King-Regent of High Ainon in 4121&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Unification Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;.

At some point between the conquest of Shimeh in 4112 and the beginning of the Great Ordeal's march in 4132, Soter adopted [[Nurbanu Ze]] as his son. It is likely this event took place during the Unification Wars.

=== ''The White-Luck Warrior'' ===
Following the division of the Ordeal into the Four Armies, Soter led the Ainoni contingent of the army of the [[Ketyai]] of the East&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Later, [[Halas Siroyon]] coordinated his expeditions to assess the progress of the [[Sranc]] Horde with Soter&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;.

When [[Heramari Iyokus]] argued that the [[School|Schools]] should abandon the [[Culling]], Soter argued it was necessary it should continue, or else the Ordeal would not survive long enough to reach the [[Neleöst|Neleöst Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
As [[Nersei Proyas]] relentlessly begged Anasûrimbor Kellhus for the command of the forces to be sent to [[Dagliash]], he noticed Soter and [[Hringa Vûkyelt]], among others, frowning at his infraction&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
When [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]] and [[Varalt Sorweel III|Varalt Sorweel]] returned to the Great Ordeal, Soter fell to Serwa's knees crying and asking what was happening to them&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;. After Nersei Proyas was denounced as a traitor, he noticed Soter's expression of demented outrage as he was being strung up&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the Last Whelming, Kellhus recalled the conversation he had with [[Nemukus Mirshoa]], one of Soter's vassals, addressing the King-Regent directly as well&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas]] later noticed Soter among the Lords of the Ordeal gathered to kiss his father's knee&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

For the attack on [[Golgotterath]] itself, the Ordeal was divided into three Trials&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;. Soter was given command of the Sons of Shir, who were charged with taking the Tower of [[Corrunc]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

During the battle for Golgotterath, Soter and his men were the first to assemble beneath the turrets of the High Cwol, shortly before the pulses from the [[Sun Lance]] began targeting the sorcerers and witches in their midst&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. In the chaos that followed, Soter and his Ainoni abandoned the mages to their fate and proceeded to storm the bastions and corridors of the High Cwol&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

After Serwa reencountered the rest of the Ordeal following her injury by a pulse of the Sun Lance, she found her brother [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayûtas]] standing alongside Soter and [[Apperens Saccarees]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;.

As Soter was not mentioned again following this event, it is unknown if he survived the battle or the destruction of the remainder of the Ordeal by the rise of the [[No-God]].

'''Nostol''' was a [[Meöri]] hero who lived during the time of the [[Apocalypse]].

In 2151, after the collapse of the Meöri Empire, Nostol and a band of his followers allied with [[Gin'yursis]], the [[Nonman]] King of [[Cil-Aujas]]. Together, they held back the Horde of the [[No-God]] at the [[Battle of Kathol Pass]], which would be humanity's only victory during the Years of the Crib. However, the [[Men]] resented their Nonmen allies, and the following year betrayed and killed the Nonmen of Cil-Aujas.&lt;ref&gt;The Judging Eye, Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Nostol and his followers would go on to become the forefathers of the [[Galeoth]]. Common legend holds that the famous fractiousness of the Galeoth is due to a curse placed on the traitorous Nostol and his followers by Gin'yursis. In actuality, Gin'yursis was not so discriminate in his dying; he cursed all Men.&lt;ref&gt;The Judging Eye, Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Oirinas and his twin [[Oirûnas]] were members of the First Watch on the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. When the [[Inchoroi]] attacked, Oirinas and Oirûnas were the only two survivors, and rode hard to warn [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]].

After the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], the two were assigned the duty of recruiting [[Men]] for the Second Watch.

Oirinas and Oirûnas later engaged the Inchoroi once more on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]], where Oirinas was slain.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, Cûno-Inchoroi Wars&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oirûnas''' is a [[Nonman]] hero who fought in the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] and is currently imprisoned in the deeps of [[Ishterebinth]]. He is the father of another famed Nonman hero, [[Oinaral]] Lastborn.

Oirûnas and his twin [[Oirinas]] were members of the First Watch on the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. When the [[Inchoroi]] attacked, Oirinas and Oirûnas were the only two survivors, and rode hard to warn [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]].

After the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], the two were assigned the duty of recruiting [[Men]] for the Second Watch.

Oirûnas succumbed to the Dolour and confined himself to the Deep. Later Oinaral and Sorweel used him to cleanse Ishterebinth from the Vile. Oinaral sacrificed himself so the old warrior would regain his facilities. Oirûnas killed [[Harapior]] with his sword and burned [[Nin'ciljiras]] alive, starting the war between the Ishroi of the Weeping Mountain.

'''Titirga''' was the Archideme of the [[School]] of [[Sohonc]]. One of the most powerful sorcerers ever to have lived in [[Eärwa]], even surpassing most of the [[Nonmen]]. He was killed by [[Shaeönanra]] and [[Aurang]] in 1119 ([[Year-of-the-Tusk]]).&lt;ref name="fs"&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and appearance==
Titirga was tall and broad shouldered, with a shallow nose and thick brows and cheeks. His hair was white, although it is implied that it was originally golden. He had a bronzed skull of an infant child braided into his beard as a totem. Titirga carried with him a [[Sorcery|sorcerous]] artifact known as the [[False Sun]], which was given to him by the Nonman [[Emilidis]].&lt;ref name="fs" /&gt;

{{Blockquote|They said he had been blind as a child, that [[Noshainrau]] himself had found him begging in the streets. They said he went mad while Canting. They said his words seized things that should not be seized.|Shaeönanra about Titirga&lt;ref name="fs" /&gt;}}

'''From 'The False Sun'''': He wore a Pircondi cloak over his black woolen robes, two wolfskins sewn together, so that the tailings of the face fluttered side-by-side below his groin. His hair was white spun with the odd memory of gold. But it was his high blunt face that commanded attention: shallow of nose, thick of brow and cheek.

And of course the bronzed skull of an infant child braided into his beard–his famed totem.

==Story==
==='''''The False Sun'''''===
[[File:FalseSun.jpg|thumb|300px|The Glorious Pupil, Titirga, Grandmaster of the Sohonc, shines the famed Day Lantern on Shaeönanra, Grandmaster of the Mangaecca and dread leader of the Unholy Consult.]]
Titirga visits the tower of [[Nogaral]], the stronghold of the School of [[Mangaecca]], carrying his False Sun. He plans to deliver an ultimatum to the Archideme of the Mangaecca, [[Shaeönanra]], who awaits him at the tower. Titirga says that the reason for his visit is that he'd heard rumors that the Mangaecca had ''found'' something, referring to the [[Incû-Holoinas|Ark]] of the [[Inchoroi]]. Shaeönanra reminds him that the Ark is sealed and hidden by a glamour, implying that it cannot be entered. In truth, Shaeönanra, had already broken the glamour about the Ark and entered it.

Shaeönanra leads Titirga down the reception hall and into an expansive hub inside Nogaral called [[Asinna]]. Titirga senses someone beneath him, someone deeply stained with the [[Mark]] of sorcery. Shaeönanra offers to make the person withdraw but Titirga insists that he remains close so that he can keep his eye on him. Then Shaeönanra summons their 'guest', [[Aurang]], an Inchoroi. Titirga calls the thing obscene.

Aurang asks Titirga whether he fears damnation, Titirga replies that the Nonmen taught him to hide his voice in order to bypass the [[Outside]] and find oblivion, in other words, he worships the spaces between the Gods. Aurang tells him that he is damned according to the [[Inverse Fire]]. Titiga says that the Inverse Fire is nothing but a 'goad'. He says that the Mangaecca have been enslaved by the [[Tekne]].

Shaeönanra, finally fed up with arguing, asks Titirga to reveal the real reason he's there, Tiriga says that he has come to kill the Inchoroi. But the floor beneath him suddenly drops and Titirga falls into a vast pit called the [[Viritic Well]].&lt;ref name="fs" /&gt;

'''Ankaryotis''' is a [[Ciphrang]], a divine agency (demon) of the [[Outside]] and one of the more manageable Potents controlled by the [[Scarlet Spires]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ankaryotis’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Ankaryotis takes material form as a writhing abomination with “scales like knives and limbs like iron pillars.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; The demon’s large head is described as “elephantine” and it has “a great maw ringed by eyes.”

==Story==
===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
When [[Drusas Achamian]] escapes his imprisonment by the Scarlet Spires, [[Heramari Iyokus]] summons Ankaryotis to kill him. The two fight, and Achamian eventually defeats Ankaryotis, sending the demon back to the Outside.

'''Hertata''' is an orphan boy who lives in [[Sumna]].

He always repeats the last words of his sentences, which has resulted in him gaining derogatory nicknames such as Hertata-tata and Echo. Hertata prostitutes himself for food because he is too afraid to steal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===

Hertata convinces his friend [[Sol]] to come with him to the stone quay to see the departure of [[Maithanet]], whom Hertata reveres. Sol is concerned with the danger posed by slavers, who hold their markets at the quay, but Hertata believes they will not show themselves in the presence of Maithanet for fear of being damned. At the Shrial Procession, Hertata catches Maithanet’s eye and the Shriah smiles at him. When he turns to leave, Hertata is then captured by a slaver, though Sol escapes.

The Surdu preserved their [[Inrithi]] traditions for centuries after Enathpaneah fell to the [[Fanim]]. When the [[Holy War]] marches on Shimeh, a number of Surdu offer to join the Holy War and guide them through the [[Betmulla Mountains]]. However, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] senses deception, and it is subsequently revealed that Padirajah [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]] abducted their wives and children to compel them to join and then betray the Holy War. Kellhus has the Surdu men publically flayed&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Zioz''' is a [[Ciphrang]], a divine agency (demon) of the [[Outside]], controlled by the [[Scarlet Spires]].

Zioz is strong-willed and therefore very dangerous to summon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras]] regards the demon as too risky to use.

==Appearance==
Zioz is an incorporeal being in the normal state, but takes a material form with “a face like summer sunlight and limbs barked in fire.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
===''The Thousandfold Thought''===
In preparation for the attack on [[Shimeh]], [[Heramari Iyokus]] summons Zioz and sends it to attack the [[Cishaurim]]. This forces the Cishaurim to redistribute their [[Chorae]] to guard against further incursions by Ciphrang, reducing the number that will be available for use against the Scarlet Spires during the main assault.

[[File:Witch king by spiralhorizon-d7wtz8m.jpg|thumb|300px|Su’juroit, the great Nonman Witch-King. Only mentioned once, and probably not to be featured again in the narrative, but evokes a mysterious character nonetheless.]]
'''Su’juroit''' was a [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Qûya]] who was capable of using [[Gnosis|Gnostic]] cants with not merely the two standard strings (one utteral, one inutteral), but rather three strings (one utteral, two inutteral).

Stories of Su’juroit were passed down to [[Men]] during the [[Nonman Tutelage]], but he is considered a myth by most users of the Gnosis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; Three-phrase “metagnostic” cants would not be used again for thousands of years, until their rediscovery by [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].

'''Sol''' is an orphan who lives in the city of [[Sumna]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===

Sol is convinced by his friend and fellow orphan [[Hertata]] to travel to Sumna’s stone quays to see the departure of [[Maithanet]], whom Hertata reveres. Sol is concern by the danger of slavers, who hold their markets in the quays, but Hertata believes that no one would dare sin in Maithanet’s presence for fear of being damned. The two boys attend the procession, and Maithanet smiles in Hertata’s direction. After the procession, Hertata is captured by a slaver, but Sol is fast enough to escape.

'''Anasûrimbor Kelmomas''' is the third son and sixth child of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] and [[Esmenet]], and the twin brother of [[Anasûrimbor Samarmas|Samarmas]]. He was named after [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]]&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Appearance==
Kelmomas has curly blond hair&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, blue eyes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;, pale skin&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; and a cherubic face&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Personality ==
He is cunning and murderously jealous of his mother's affection.

==Story==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
From birth, he and his twin locked gazes with the other for the first (very) few years of their lives. If they were ever forced to be apart, each sank into total despondency. Soon after they separated psychologically, it was discovered that Kelmomas inherited [[Dûnyain]] traits while Samarmas did not.

===''The Judging Eye''===
Kelmomas murdered his twin in a very convincing accident.

===''The White Luck Warrior''===

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
Kelmomas is fascinated the [[White-Luck Warrior|Narindar]] and follows him throughout the tunnels of the palace. He feels the [[Ajokli|Four-Horned Brother]] will keep him safe.

Kelmomas is afraid that his sister [[Anasûrimbor Theliopa|Theliopa]] will reveal his secrets to their mother.{{6|16}}

===''The Unholy Consult''===
Kelmomas, along with Esmenet, is taken from Momemn to the camp outside [[Golgotterath]] by Kellhus. He stops [[Varalt Sorweel III|Sorweel]], who is acting as an instrument of [[Yatwer]], from killing Kellhus. In the [[Golden Room]], he dispels Ajokli's possession of Kellhus, leading to Kellhus's death. He is forced into the Carapace by the D[[Dûnyain|û]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;nyain that have taken over [[Consult|the consult]], and becomes the [[No-God]].

'''Iëva''' was the wife of [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]], the youngest son of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II|Celmomas II]], the High King of [[Kûniüri]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Story ==
Iëva was married to Nau-Cayûti in or around 2133&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[http://www.second-apocalypse.com/index.php?topic=2662.msg44215#msg44215 See here for calculation]&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to [[the Sagas]], she murdered her husband by poisoning him&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Apocalypse'&lt;/ref&gt;. She is also believed by some scholars to have murdered General [[En-​Kaujalau|En-​Kau­jalau]] in much the same way&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;As Iëva was executed in 2140 and En-Kaujalau only died the following year, it would seem that Mandate scholars are right in this matter.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Visions into the past received by [[Drusas Achamian]] through [[Seswatha's Dreams]] later suggested that the poison merely paralyzed Nau-Cayûti&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;. Iëva was revealed to have been working for [[Consult|the Consult]] "to save her soul" (according to [[Shaeönanra|Shauriatas]])&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; and ensured her husband was buried, rather than burned as was the custom&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Nau-Cayûti was then exhumed from his grave by [[Aurang]] and taken as a prisoner to [[Golgotterath]]&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was eventually discovered that Iëva was responsible for Nau-Cayûti's death, as she was tried and executed for her crime in 2140&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Iëva'&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Appearance ==
Iëva had long blonde hair, which was so pale as to be almost white&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

== Trivia ==
* Iëva's year of birth is initially given as 2125 and her year of death as 2146&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Character and Faction Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;. However, her entry in the second Encyclopedic Glossary states she was born in 2112 and died in 2140&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.
* Iëva is the only known female member of the Consult.

The '''Swayal Compact''' is the first and only [[The Schools|School]] for [[witch]]es in [[Eärwa]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;. It was founded following [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]’ unification of the [[Three Seas]] into the [[New Empire]]. The school for female [[sorcerer]]s is located in [[Iothiah]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;, and its current Grandmistress is [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Swayal Witches accompany Anasûrimbor Kellhus’s [[Great Ordeal]] on its march to [[Golgotterath]]. When Kellhus declared the Breaking of the Great Ordeal at the Eleventh Council of Potentates, the Swayal Sisterhood was ordered to join the Men of the Middle-North under the command of Prince [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas]]&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">'''Siöl''' was once the largest, most populous and most powerful [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Mansion]]. It was located in the [[Great Kayarsus]] Mountains, north of the [[Cerish|Sea of Cerish]], from where its [[Reach]] extended across much of north-eastern [[Eärwa]]. Several thousand years before the [[Breaking of the Gates]], it's king was [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], the greatest of the Nonman Kings.

Siöl was already mighty when the [[Incû-Holoinas]] fell from the skies into the south-western peaks of the [[Yimaleti Mountains]], devastating the lands controlled by [[Nin’janjin]], the King of [[Viri]]. Nin'janjin pleaded for aid but Cû’jara-Cinmoi instead invaded and occupied his lands. Faced with famine and starvation, Nin'janjin surrendered without offering battle; Viri became a bloodless tributary of Siöl. Cû’jara-Cinmoi then conquered the mansions of [[Nihrimsul]] - where her King, [[Sin’niroiha]] (“First Among Peoples” in Ihrimsû), was forced to wash the sword of Cû’jara-Cinmoi - and [[Cil-Aujas]]. This extended the Reach of Siöl as far west as the Yimaleti and [[Demua Mountains]] and south to the shores of the [[Meneanor|Meaneanor Sea]], creating one of the largest land empires in the history of Eärwa. Cû’jara-Cinmoi proudly styled himself the "King of Four Mansions"; after the successful rebellion of Nihrimsul he reluctantly adjusted this to "King of Three Mansions".

During the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], Siöl suffered serious losses in battle, as well as the loss of its entire female population. The Mansion survived the wars - although the records are confusing - but it was then destroyed in the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]] that followed the Breaking of the Gates. Indeed, some hold that the Gates and Siöl are one and the same, and the destruction of Siöl heralded the arrival of Men in Eärwa.

Siöl claimed to be the First Mansion, the ancestral home of all Nonmen, founded directly by the progenitors of the Nonmen race in a time so ancient as to defy reckoning. For this reason Siöl took the title "House Primordial", a term used to refer to both the Mansion and its ruling family. Extant records support this, tracing a line of founding from Siöl to first [[Ishoriöl]], [[Viri]], [[Illisserû]], and [[Cil-Aujas]]. Those Mansions turn later founded [[Curunq]], [[Incissal]], and [[Cil-Aumûl]]. Nihrimsul was founded separately and outside of this line of descent, although its claim to have originally founded Siöl (and thus being the true House Primordial) was hotly denied by Siöl.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Nine Mansions'&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baxatas''' is the General of the [[Selial Column]] during the [[Holy War]] following the death of [[Praxum Bogras]].

==Story==

===''The Thousandfold Thought''===

Baxatas is among those sent by [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] to [[Joktha]] with [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]] and [[Ikurei Conphas]]. He is one of the men loyal to Conphas, and is thus ordered by Cnaiür to be sent away on one of the transports coming for Conphas. When Baxatas arrives at the harbor, his hands are bound and he is being held prisoner by the [[Hemscilvara]], indicating that he resisted the order.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; He departs by transport before the beginning of the battle between the Hemscilvara and the forces loyal to Conphas.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="499">'''Sheära''' ("Sun-skin") is a type of enchanted mail created by the ancient [[School]] of [[Mihtrûl]].

In [[The White-Luck Warrior (Book)|The White-Luck Warrior]], [[Drusas Achamian]] discovers a shirt of sheära in the Coffers of the [[Library of Sauglish]], which he gives to [[Mimara]]. The mail is golden in color, as light as silk but as hard as [[nimil]], and hums with warmth.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="860">'''Chipmunk''' is a magic knife found by [[Mimara]] in the Coffers of the [[Library of Sauglish]].

It is made of bronze and engraved with glowering runes&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 15, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt;. It was enchanted by the ancient [[School]] of [[Mihtrûl]] to have an otherworldly edge, capable of cutting with ease despite feeling rounded to the touch. It also cuts only according to the wielder's desire&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Interlude, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;.

In ''The Great Ordeal'', Mimara and [[Drusas Achamian]] catch the Dunyain boy scraping it against a [[chorae]]. Achamian says that it must have been made by [[Emilidis]], the greatest of the the ancient [[Nonmen]] artificers, which is why it was stored in the Coffers&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 17, p.470&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Varalt Sorweel''' '''III''' is the King of [[Sakarpus]] and the only son of Varalt Harweel II, the former King of Sakarpus.

==Story==

===''The Judging Eye''===
In [[Sakarpus]], Sorweel finds himself staring down upon the boggling might of the Great Ordeal. Standing with his father on the high curtain walls, he realizes that he and his people are doomed. [[Varalt Harweel II|King Harweel]] commands that Sorweel be taken to safety. Dragged away screaming, the young man watches sorcerous flames engulf the parapets and his father upon them. A desperate flight ensues, and it seems that the [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Aspect-Emperor]] himself pursues them through the chaotic streets. The pursuit ends in the apparent safety of the citadel. Blasting through walls, Anasûrimbor Kellhus kills his protectors, embraces the Prince, and tells him that he is forgiven.

The city secured, Sorweel becomes the new king of Sacarpus. Before the host departs, [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II|Moënghus]] and [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayûtas]], the eldest sons of Anasûrimbor Kellhus, visit him in his palace. They tell him he is to join the Ordeal as the symbol of his nation's commitment to their holy cause. The following day Sorweel finds himself part of the Scions, a horse company composed of princely hostages from across the rim of the [[New Empire]]. This is how he meets and befriends [[Zsoronga ut Nganka’kull]], the Successor Prince of [[Zeüm]]. A [[Mandate]] sorcerer named [[Eskeles]] is assigned to tutor him in Sheyic, the common tongue of the Three Seas, and through him the young King learns the reasons why so many worship the Aspect-Emperor so fervently. For the first time he begins to doubt his father... What if the Aspect-Emperor spoke true?

Sorweel is also provided a slave named [[Porsparian]] to attend to his needs. One night Sorweel watches him tear away the turf and mould the face of the Goddess [[Yatwer]] from the dirt. Before his eyes, mud bubbles up as spit from her earthen lips. The slave palms this mud and smears it across the incredulous King's cheeks.

The following morning Sorweel attends a Council of Potentates with Zsoronga and Eskeles. He watches the Aspect-Emperor move from lord to lord, declaring the truths they think hidden in their souls. He fears what will happen when he sees the hatred and treachery smouldering in his own. But when Anasûrimbor Kellhus comes to him, he congratulates Sorweel for grasping the truth and, before everyone assembled, declares him one of the Believer-Kings.

Serwa is considered very beautiful&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;. She is tall and slender&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, with long flaxen hair&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; and blue eyes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Her skin is pale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, and she has freckles about the bridge of her nose&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;. Her profile resembles that of her mother on the silver Kellic&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

After she is hit by a pulse of the [[Sun Lance]] during the battle for [[Golgotterath]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;, Serwa is severely burned. Her hair is almost completely burned off, and ulcerating burns cover the majority of her body, with only part of her face, the lower part of her legs and pubic area remaining unburnt&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;. Close to the end of her duel with [[Skuthula]], Serwa is struck by a [[Chorae]], which salts off part of her right arm&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

== Skills ==
Serwa is widely thought to be the most powerful witch in the world&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', What Has Come Before&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;. She is one of only three sorcerers capable of performing Metagnostic cants such as the Cant of Translocation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Story==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
Serwa was born in [[Carythusal]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; during the [[Unification Wars]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, "Unification Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;. At the age of three, it was discovered that she possessed the Gift of the [[the Few|Few]] and she was sent to [[Iothiah]] to be raised among the Swayal witches&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;. Esmenet, who was strongly opposed to this decision, never quite forgave Kellhus for it&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

===''The Judging Eye''===
Serwa is mentioned as marching with her father and her brothers [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus II|Moënghus]] and [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayûtas]] in the Great Ordeal&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. She is present in the meeting [[Varalt Sorweel|Sorweel]] has with Kayûtas (in which he is informed a [[Thanteus Eskeles|tutor]] has been chosen for him)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Serwa also attends the Council of Potentates, in which Sorweel is declared a Believer-King&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
Serwa, Moënghus, and Sorweel are sent to the Nonman mansion of [[Ishterebinth]] to act as hostages.

It is revealed she suffers the same nightmares experienced by [[Mandate]] Schoolmen of the [[Apocalypse]] as witnessed through [[Seswatha]]'s eyes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===

===''The Unholy Consult''===
Serwa duels the great [[Wracu]] known as Skuthula the Black within the [[Intrinsic Gate]] during the final cataclysmic battle for Golgotterath&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''The Unholy Consult, ''Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Blockquote|Something must be eaten.|Anasûrimbor Kayûtas}}

'''Anasûrimbor''' '''Kayûtas '''is the first son and eldest child of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] and [[Esmenet]], and General of the [[Kidruhil]]. He was named after [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Appearance==
Kayûtas closely resembles his father, Kellhus&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. He is tall and slender&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, and has blond hair&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;, blue eyes&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; and a long face&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;. His hair is cropped very short, revealing the contours of his skull&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (however, by the time the Great Ordeal reaches [[Agongorea]], it has grown enough to be described as "flowing")&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;. He has a plaited beard&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==Story==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
Kayûtas was born in [[Shimeh]], close enough to Moënghus's birth that the two were raised as fraternal twins&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''The Judging Eye''===
Kayûtas rides with his father's [[Great Ordeal]], leading the Kidruhil&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
At the Eleventh Council of Potentates, Anasûrimbor Kellhus declares the breaking of the Great Ordeal, and Kayûtas is given command of the Men of the Middle North&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===

===''The Unholy Consult''===
At the first Council after [[Dagliash]], Prince [[Nurbanu Ze]] openly confronts Proyas, claiming that Kellhus died in the fire. Kayûtas slays him in the blink of an eye, restoring the Anasûrimbor authority over the Great Ordeal.

Despite his Dunyain origins, Kayûtas, along with the whole Ordeal, succumbs to the Meat. He and the Exalt-General Nersei Proyas become lovers for some time. It is Kayûtas who bids Proyas accept cannibalism, claiming that ''something must be eaten''. As the Great Ordeal falls on the Scalded, Kayûtas does participate. When [[Anasûrimbor Serwa|Serwa]] and Sorweel see him, the kilt on his groin is stained with blood, implying that he took part in the unholy congress with dead or dying Ordealmen.

Later on, Kayûtas is involved in the assault at [[Golgotterath]]. He and his sister Serwa fight the great dragon [[Scuthula]] guarding the [[Intrinsic Gate]]. Kayûtas' fate after the Resumption is unclear.

'''Anasûrimbor Moënghus II''' is officially the son of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] and his first wife, [[Serwë]], thus being the eldest of the Prince-Imperials. In truth, he is Serwë's son by [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha]].
==Appearance==

He has a mane of black hair&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;, pale blue ("white-blue") eyes&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; and pale skin&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;. He is described as having a "neck-breaking physique"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. His features are somewhat more aquiline than Cnaiür's&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Story==

=== ''The Warrior-Prophet'' ===
Moënghus was born in [[Caraskand]] in the early winter of 4111&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;. After Serwë's death, he was taken by [[Esmenet]] and raised as one of her children&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Thousandfold Thought'' ===

===''The Judging Eye''===
Moënghus marches with his father, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]], in the Great Ordeal. [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayutas]] warns [[Varalt Sorweel III|Sorweel]] that Moënghus is mad.

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===

'''Anasûrimbor''' '''Theliopa''' was the eldest daughter and second child of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] and [[Esmenet]]. Over the course of the [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] series, she remained with her mother in [[Momemn]] in her capacity as Imperial Adviser&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', What Has Come Before&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Appearance==
Theliopa was tall and pale-skinned like her father&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, with sallow blonde hair&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and pale blue eyes&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;. She was thin to the point of emaciation, her features angular and her skin being referred to as "tented over the woodwork of her bones"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;.

She was known for wearing outlandish garments of her own design and arranging her hair in equally eccentric hairstyles&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Personality ==
Theliopa was remarkably intelligent, but almost completely devoid of emotion and oblivious to most social norms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. She almost always avoided meeting other people's gazes&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;, her stare being very intense on the rare occasions she did so&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;. She spoke with a very high and cold voice&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and possessed a verbal tic that manifested as the repetition of certain words&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

She was an avid reader, remembering all she read with perfect detail&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;. However, she was so consumed by her interests she often forgot to eat or sleep, having to be forced to do so (the latter situation resulting in her emaciated state)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

==Story==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
Theliopa was born in [[Nenciphon]] during the [[Unification Wars]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Unification Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;, probably in or around the winter of 4113&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Due to her prodigious intellect and memory, she was made an Imperial Adviser at the age of twelve&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

At some point during her youth, she underwent a traumatic experience (presumably involving rape) at the hands of her brother [[Anasûrimbor Inrilatas|Inrilatas]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This was likely the catalyst for Kellhus' decision to imprison his son (it is implied Esmenet never learned about this)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This event remained the only thing to cause Theliopa to show any kind of emotion, as [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas|Kelmomas]] discovered years later&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;.
===''The Judging Eye''===
Theliopa was one of her mother's closest advisers in the [[Andiamine Heights]], using her [[Dûnyain]] mental abilities to provide detailed reports and oversee Esmenet's meetings with various dignitaries. She was also the one to detect a [[skin-spy]] among the stable slaves in Momemn.

She was present when [[Anasûrimbor Samarmas|Samarmas]] was killed in an accident engineered by Kelmomas, the latter describing her as observing the scene "with fey curiosity".
===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
After Esmenet started to mistrust [[Maithanet]], she asked her daughter for advice on how to gauge his true intentions. Theliopa eventually suggested that Inrilatas could read their uncle's face, as he had been the only one trained to do so by their father.

When the Andiamine Heights were stormed by Maithanet's men in the coup following Inrilatas' murder, Theliopa told her brother Kelmomas to run.

Later, during Maithanet's reconciliation with Esmenet, he told her that Theliopa was safe.

===''The Great Ordeal''===
Theliopa advised her mother against forgiving [[Naree]] for betraying her location (and indirectly causing [[Imhailas]]' death). She offered to kill Naree herself, but Esmenet declined.

It is revealed that Theliopa had grown increasingly suspicious of Kelmomas's behaviour since the events following Maithanet's murder of Inrilatas. She confronted her younger brother, telling him that she had figured out that he was more than he seemed, and asked him if he had been the one to kill [[Biaxi Sankas]]. When Kelmomas denied it, she left him alone, but not before threatening him, as Momemn needed its Empress, and Kelmomas was making her weak (and the revelation of his crimes would make the situation even worse).

Later, while Esmenet was giving Kelmomas a bath, Theliopa arrived to inform her mother that General [[Iskaul]] had arrived. Esmenet promptly left, asking her daughter to finish bathing Kelmomas. Theliopa then told her brother that she knew that he had made the decision to kill her. Kelmomas, in turn, brought up the past incident between her and Inrilatas, reminding her of how he would call her "Sranky". Overcome by uncharacteristic emotion, she quickly fled the room.

Some time after that, Kelmomas tracked the [[White-Luck Warrior]] to his own bedroom. He watched as Theliopa walked in and confronted the White-Luck Warrior, who made it clear that she was "already dead", him just being "someone who was there when it happened". At the end of their conversation, an earthquake wracked the city, causing Theliopa to be crushed by falling debris. After the White-Luck Warrior left the now-destroyed room, Kelmomas walked to Theliopa and smashed her head with a brick to make sure she was dead. He then pretended to cry over her body. By the time a grieving Esmenet found her daughter's body, she caught a glimpse of Kelmomas' joyful expression.

== Trivia ==
* Theliopa is the only one of Kellhus and Esmenet's children not to have a clear or probable namesake. [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas|Kayûtas]], [[Anasûrimbor Serwa|Serwa]] and [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas|Kelmomas]] are explicitly named after [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]], [[Serwë]] and [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], respectively&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Anasûrimbor Inrilatas|Inrilatas]]' name is likely derived from that of [[Inri Sejenus]], while [[Anasûrimbor Samarmas|Samarmas]]' is quite similar to those of [[Samarmau Uän]] or [[Sag-Marmau]].

No matter how hard he drinks, gambles, or womanizes, Disciple Manning simply cannot forget: not a word spoken, not an image glimpsed, not a pain suffered. Disciple Manning has total recall.

[[The Enlightened Dead]] is a rumoured followup, although there are more rumoures that it may never be published due to the low volume of sales that Disciple of The Dog has generated.

==Premise==

No matter how hard he drinks, gambles, or womanizes, Disciple Manning simply cannot forget: not a word spoken, not an image glimpsed, not a pain suffered. Disciple Manning has total recall. Whatever he hears, he can remember with 100% accuracy. He can play it back in his head for an infinite number of times without a single change. This ability makes him a dangerously unorthodox private investigator.

When a New Jersey couple hires Manning to find their daughter, who joined a religious cult before vanishing in a small rust-belt town called Ruddick, he finds himself embroiled in a mystery that will pit his unnatural ability to remember against his desperate desire to forget.

{{Blockquote|Everything was so agonizingly tight, as though the flesh of the world had been dried taut across the gaps between bone: the net against stone, the grid of shadows cast over the hollows, the watery beads cupped between the flex of tendons on his hands — so clear! And within this tightness, the sensation of inner blooming, of the collapse of seeing into being, as though his eyes had been wrung into the very heart of things. From the surface of the stone, he could see himself, a dark child towering across the disc of the sun. The very fabric of existence. The onta.{{1|3}}}}

==Effect of Sorcery on the onta==
Aside from the [[Psûkhe]], which may or may not be a true form of [[sorcery]], all sorcerous manifestations and practitioners leave a [[Mark]] on the onta, also called the 'bruising of the onta'.{{EG|Mark}}

It follows the Point of View of Thomas Bible, a psychology professor, who is recruited by the FBI in order to help them track down his best friend Neil Cassidy, a neurologist in the employment of the NSA, who has gone rogue and is apparently abducting people and re-wiring their brains as part of an elaborate attempt to demonstrate the illusory nature of the self and much of consciousness.

==Book Description==

Tom's life is not what it once was. His marriage is on the rocks and he is barely allowed to see his two young children. His writing career has stalled with only one successful book, and he is forced to spend his time teaching bored grad students. Then his best friend, Neil, returns from teaching neurology in California and comes back into Tom's life. But all is not what it seems--Neil has been working for the U.S. government cracking the minds of suspected terrorists and has gone AWOL, leaving behind evidence that he has been employing his unique skills on civilians.

Thus begins a terrifying sequence of events as Neil, obsessed with the fact that he can control the human brain, sets out to destroy those who are connected to Tom. And it's only when Neil gets closer to his ultimate target that the full horror of his plan is revealed.

'''Yatwer''' is the Goddess of the Earth and Fertility, and one of the so-called Compensatory [[Gods]], who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife.{{EG|Yatwer}} Her symbol is a harvest sickle that also forms the outline of a pregnant belly.{{4|5}} Yatwer is a point of view character in ''[[The White-Luck Warrior (Book)|The White-Luck Warrior]]''. Her point of view is the only God point of view in the series.{{5|10}}

==Depiction in the Holy Texts==
In the ''[[Higarata]]'', Yatwer is depicted as a beneficent, all-forgiving matron, capable of seeding and furrowing the fields of nations with a single hand. Some commentators have noted that Yatwer is anything but revered in either the ''Higarata'' or ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'' (wherein “tillers of soil” are often referred to with contempt). Perhaps this is why Yatwerians tend to rely on their own scripture, the ''[[Sinyatwa]]'', for their liturgical rites and ceremonies.{{EG|Yatwer}}

==Cult of Yatwer==
: ''Main article: [[Cult of Yatwer]]''

Yatwer is far and away the most popular of the [[Cults|Cultic]] [[Gods|Deities]], she is especially favoured by the lower [[caste|castes]] — some six out of ten caste-menials regularly attend a Yatwerian rite. Based in [[Iothiah]], her Cult enjoys a vast number of adherents, but despite that, it remains one of the more impoverished and seems to generate a large number of zealous devotees as a result.{{EG|Yatwer}}

==Story==
===''The Judging Eye''===
Yatwer manifests as a shadow to the Mother-Supreme of the Cult of Yatwer, [[Psatma Nannaferi]], and informs her that the [[White-Luck Warrior]] has arrived, and that the “Demon,” the [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Aspect-Emperor]], will be driven to his doom.{{4|5}}

===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
Yatwer appears to [[Varalt Sorweel]] and hands him a pouch with a [[Chorae]] in it.{{5|10}}

The '''Gates of Eärwa''' or '''Gates of Thayant''' are a series of fortified passes through the [[Great Kayarsus|Great Northern Kayarsus]] Mountains. Their precise location is not known, but is assumed to be north of the [[Cerish|Sea of Cerish]], possibly in the vicinity of the long-fallen [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Mansion]] of [[Siöl]]. Some historians hold that the Gates and Siöl are one and the same, and the Breaking of the Gates also refers to the destruction of the mansion of Siöl.

==The Breaking of the Gates==
The name given to the assault on the Gates of Eärwa by four of the [[Five Tribes of Men]] from [[Eänna]]. The commandment of [[Gods|the Gods]] to throw down the [[Mansion|mansions]] of the "[[Nonmen|Not Us]]" was given to [[Angeshraël]] on [[Mount Eshki]] and was enscribed on the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]]. Men were led by the Chieftan Kings: [[Mamayma]], [[Inshull]], [[Shelgal]], [[Nomur|Nomer]], and [[Uskelt Wolfheart]]. Since ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'' ends with the determination to invade [[Eärwa]], or the “Land of the Felled Sun,” and the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] Mansions most involved in resisting the Tribes of Men were all destroyed, very little is known either of the Breaking of the Gates or of the subsequent migratory invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Breaking of the Gates’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Nihrimsûl'&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutadra ("Soot") is a [[Skin Eater]], and a rumoured [[Fanim]] heretic.&lt;ref&gt;The White-Luck Warrior: Character and Faction Glossary, 'The Scalpoi'.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a survivor of [[Cil-Aujas]] and journeyed with the Skin Eaters to the Mop.

He was murdered by [[Stone Hags|Stone Hag]] archers during a sneak attack in the Mop. He received an arrow in the cheek that entered his throat. While he was dying, [[Mimara]]'s [[Judging Eye]] opened and saw that Sutadra's entire life was a mix of both weakness and honor. He joined the Skin Eaters as a form of penance for past deeds, but Mimara saw that he was ultimately damned. As Mimara weeped for him, [[Kosoter]] pressed the arrow further down Sutadra's throat killing him instantly.

The most common types of Wards (found in both [[Anagogic]] and [[Gnostic]] sorceries) are: Wards of Exposure, which provide advance warning of intruders or imminent attacks; Shield-Wards, which provide direct protection against offensive sorceries; and Skin-Wards, which provide “protection of last resort” against all types of threat.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Wards'&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Sagas]], [[Seswatha]] was able to convince Nau-Cayûti (who was once his student) that she could be rescued from the [[Incû-Holoinas]], and the two of them embarked on an expedition that is almost certainly apocryphal. [[Mandate]] commentators dispute the account found in The Sagas, where they successfully return with both Aulisi and the [[Heron Spear]], claiming that Aulisi was never found.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Apocalypse'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''White-Luck Warrior''' is the god-sent assassin who will murder the [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Aspect-Emperor]] and his progeny.

In [[Inrithism]], the White-Luck Warrior is the man who walks the perfect line of action and happenstance that can see any outcome come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="688">The '''Judging Eye''' is a mystical ability that [[Mimara]] possesses, allowing her to see the marks of good and evil deeds on people’s souls, but it manifests only intermittently.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Drusas Achamian]], the Judging Eye is the eye of the Unborn; it involves pregnant women, and those possessing it give birth to dead children.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior,'' Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 4132, Mimara exorcised the [[Gin’yursis|Wight-in-the-Mountain]] that had been haunting the halls of [[Cil-Aujas]] using her Judging Eye and a [[Chorae]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="726">'''''Aspect-Emperor''''' is the title taken by [[Ceneian Empire|Ceneian]] Emperor [[Triamis I]] in the twenty-third year of his rule (2500 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]]) when the [[Shriah]], [[Ekyannus III]], formally institutionalized the so-called Emperor Cult. The title was adopted by all of Traimis I’s successors.{{EG|Aspect-Emperor}} The word ‘Aspect’ in ‘Aspect-Emperor’ comes from [[Inri Sejenus]]’s reinterpretation of the [[Gods]] as ‘aspects’ of the God.

[[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] was declared Aspect-Emperor of the [[Three Seas]] in 4112 (Year-of-the-Tusk),{{3|17}} the first in a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Judging Eye]]'', What Has Come Before...&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="660">A means of generating random numerical results for the purposes of gambling. The first references to number-sticks reach as far back as ancient [[Shigek]]. The most common variations consist of two sticks typically referred to as the Fat and the Skinny. A groove is carved all the way through the Fat so that the Skinny can drop up and down its interior length. The Skinny is then capped on either end to prevent it from falling out. Numerical values are marked along the length of the Fat, so that when the sticks are thrown, the Skinny can indicate a result.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'number-sticks'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">[[File:Onkis.jpg|thumb|300px|Goddess of hope and aspiration, Onkis is also known as the Singer-in-the-Dark, she who drives men to forever reach for more than they can hold.]]
'''Onkis''' is the Goddess of hope and aspiration. One of the so-called Compensatory [[Gods]], who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Onkis draws followers from all walks of life, though rarely in great numbers.

She is only mentioned twice in the ''[[Higarata]],'' and in the (likely apocryphal) ''[[Parnishtas]]'' she is portrayed as a prophetess, not of the future, but of the motivations of Men. The so-called “shakers” belong to an extreme branch of the [[Cults|Cult]], where the devotees ritually strive to be “possessed” by the Goddess. Her symbol is the Copper Tree (which also happens to be the device of the ancient Nonman Mansion of [[Siöl]], though no link has been established).{{EG|Onkis}}

Onkis is also called the Singer-in-the-Dark.{{1|4}}

Her idol depicts the severed head of a beautiful woman upon a copper tree.{{3|10}}

In the [[Irreüma]] in [[Sumna]], her idol is described as:
:“The idol worked in white marble, eyes closed with the sunken look of the dead. At first glance she appeared to be the severed head of a woman, beautiful yet vaguely common, mounted on a pole. Anything more than a glance, however, revealed the pole to be a miniature tree, like those cultivated by the ancient [[Norsirai]], only worked in bronze. Branches poked through her parted lips and swept across her face—nature reborn through human lips. Other branches reached behind to break through her frozen hair.”{{1|4}}

The idol also has a small trough gouged in her pedestal for food offerings.{{1|4}}

I shall never tire of underlining a concise little fact which these superstitious people are loath to admit—namely, that a thought comes when “it” wants, not when “I” want . . .&lt;br /&gt;—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL

==&lt;span id="cke_bm_55S" style="display: none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Prologue A – The Wastes of Kûniüri&lt;span id="cke_bm_55E" style="display: none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;==

If it is only after that we understand what has come before, then we understand nothing.  Thus we shall define the soul as follows: that which precedes everything.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

==&lt;span id="cke_bm_56S" style="display: none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Prologue B – The Wastes of Kûniüri&lt;span id="cke_bm_56E" style="display: none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;==

Nonmen, Sranc, and Men:&lt;br /&gt;The first forgets,&lt;br /&gt;The third regrets,&lt;br /&gt;And the second has all of the fun.&lt;br /&gt;—ANCIENT KÛNIÜRI NURSERY RHYME

This is a history of a great and tragic holy war, of the mighty factions that sought to possess and pervert it, and of a son searching for his father.  And as with all histories, it is we, the survivors, who will write its conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==&lt;span id="cke_bm_57S" style="display: none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Chapter One – Carythusal&lt;span id="cke_bm_57E" style="display: none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;==

There are three, and only three, kinds of men in the world: cynics, fanatics, and Mandate Schoolmen.&lt;br /&gt;—ONTILLAS, ON THE FOLLY OF MEN

The author has often observed that in the genesis of great events, men generally possess no inkling of what their actions portend.  This problem is not, as one might suppose, a result of men’s blindness to the consequences of their actions.  Rather it is a result of the mad way the dreadful turns on the trivial when the ends of one man cross the ends of another.  The Schoolmen of the Scarlet Spires have an old saying: “When one man chases a hare, he finds a hare.  But when many men chase a hare, they find a dragon.” In the prosecution of competing human interests, the result is always unknown, and all too often, terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Two – Atyersus==

I write to inform you that during my most recent audience, the Nansur Emperor, quite without provocation, publicly addressed me as “fool.”  You are, no doubt, unmoved by this.  It has become a common occurrence.  The Consult eludes us now more than ever.  We hear them only in the secrets of others.  We glimpse them only through the eyes of those who deny their very existence.  Why should we not be called fools?  The deeper the Consult secretes itself among the Great Factions, the madder our rantings sound to their ears.  We are, as the damned Nansur would say, “a hunter in the thicket”—one who, by the very act of hunting, extinguishes all hope of running down his prey.&lt;br /&gt;—ANONYMOUS MANDATE SCHOOLMAN, LETTER TO ATYERSUS

==Chapter Three – Sumna==

If the world is a game whose rules are written by the God, and sorcerers are those who cheat and cheat, then who has written the rules of sorcery?&lt;br /&gt;—ZARATHINIUS, A DEFENCE OF THE ARCANE ARTS

==Chapter Four – Sumna==

To be ignorant and to be deceived are two different things.  To be ignorant is to be a slave to the world.  To be deceived is to be the slave of another man.  The question will always be: Why, when all men are ignorant, and therefore already slaves, does this latter slavery sting us so?&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE EPISTEMOLOGIES

But despite stories of Fanim atrocities, the fact of the matter is that the Kianene, heathen or no, were surprisingly tolerant of Inrithi pilgrimages to Shimeh—before the Holy War, that is.  Why would a people devoted to the destruction of the Tusk extend this courtesy to “idolaters”? Perhaps they were partially motivated by the prospect of trade, as others have suggested.  But the fundamental motive lies in their desert heritage.  The Kianene word for a holy place is si’ihkhalis, which means, literally, “great oasis.” On the open desert it is their strict custom to never begrudge travelers water, even if they be enemies.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Five – Momemn==

The difference between the strong emperor and the weak is simply this: the former makes the world his arena, while the latter makes it his harem.&lt;br /&gt;—CASIDAS, THE ANNALS OF CENEI

What the Men of the Tusk never understood was that the Nansur and the Kianene were old enemies.  When two civilized peoples find themselves at war for centuries, any number of common interests will arise in the midst of their greater antagonism.  Ancestral foes share many things: mutual respect, a common history, triumph in stalemate, and a plethora of unspoken truces. The Men of the Tusk were interlopers, an impertinent flood that threatened to wash away the observed channels of a far older enmity.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Six – The Jiünati Steppe==

It is said: a man is born of his mother and is fed of his mother.  Then he is fed of the land, and the land passes through him, taking and giving a pinch of dust each time, until man is no longer of his mother, but of the land.&lt;br /&gt;—SCYLVENDI PROVERB

. . . and in Old Sheyic, the language of the ruling and religious castes of the Nansurium, skilvenas means “catastrophe” or “apocalypse,” as though the Scylvendi have somehow transcended the role of peoples in history and become a principle.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Seven – Momemn==

The world is a circle that possesses as many centres as it does men.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

==Chapter Eight – Momemn==

Kings never lie.  They demand the world be mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;—CONRIYAN PROVERB

When we truly apprehend the Gods, the Nilnameshi sages say, we recognize them not as kings but as thieves.  This is among the wisest of blasphemies, for we always see the king who cheats us, never the thief.&lt;br /&gt;—OLEKAROS, AVOWALS

==Chapter Nine – Sumna==

And the Nonman King cried words that sting:&lt;br /&gt;“Now to me you must confess,&lt;br /&gt;For death above you hovers!”&lt;br /&gt;And the Emissary answered ever wary:&lt;br /&gt;“We are the race of flesh,&lt;br /&gt;We are the race of lovers.”&lt;br /&gt;—“BALLAD OF THE INCHOROI,” ANCIENT KÛNIÜRI FOLK SONG

==Chapter Ten – Sumna==

How should one describe the terrible majesty of the Holy War? Even then, still unblooded, it was both frightening and wondrous to behold, a great beast whose limbs were composed of entire nations—Galeoth, Thunyerus, Ce Tydonn, Conriya, High Ainon, and the Nansurium—and with the Scarlet Spires as the dragon’s maw, no less.  Not since the days of the Ceneian Empire or the Ancient North has the world witnessed such an assembly.  Even diseased by politics, it was a thing of awe.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Eleven – Momemn==

Reason, Ajencis writes, is the capacity to overcome unprecedented obstacles in the gratification of desire.  What distinguished man from beasts is man’s capacity to overcome infinite obstacles through reason.&lt;br /&gt;But Ajencis has confused the accidental for the essential.  Prior to the capacity to overcome infinite obstacles is the capacity to confront them.  What defines man is not that he reasons, but that he prays.&lt;br /&gt;—EKYANNUS I, 44 EPISTLES

==Chapter Twelve – The Jiünati Steppe==

I have explained how Maithanet yoked the vast resources of the Thousand Temples to ensure the viability of the Holy War.  I have described, in outline, the first steps taken by the Emperor to bind the Holy War to his imperial ambitions.  I have attempted to reconstruct the initial reaction of the Cishaurim in Shimeh from their correspondence with the Padirajah in Nenciphon.  And I have even mentioned the hated Consult, of whom I can at long last speak without fear of ridicule.  I have spoken, in other words, almost exclusively of powerful factions and their impersonal ends.  What of vengeance?  What of hope?  Against the frame of competing nations and warring faiths, how did these small passions come to rule the Holy War?&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

. . . though he consorts with man, woman and child, though he lays with beasts and makes a mockery of his seed, never shall he be as licentious as the philosopher, who lays with all things imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;—INRI SEJENUS, SCHOLARS, 36, 21, THE TRACTATE

==Chapter Thirteen – The Hethanta Mountains==

Even the hard-hearted avoid the heat of desperate men.  For the bonfires of the weak crack the most stone.&lt;br /&gt;—CONRIYAN PROVERB

So who were the heroes and the cravens of the Holy War?  There are already songs enough to answer that question.  Needless to say, the Holy War provided further violent proof of Ajencis’s old proverb, “Though all men be equally frail before the world, the differences between them are terrifying.”&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Fourteen – The Kyranae Plain==

Some say men continually war against circumstances, but I say they perpetually flee.  What are the works of men if not a momentary respite, a hiding place soon to be discovered by catastrophe?  Life is endless flight before the hunter we call the world.&lt;br /&gt;—EKYANNUS VIII, 111 APHORISMS

==Chapter Fifteen – Momemn==

Many have condemned those who joined the Holy War for mercenary reasons, and doubtless, should this humble history find its way into their idle libraries, they will blast me as well.  Admittedly, my reasons for joining the Holy War were “mercenary,” if by that one means I joined it in order to procure ends outside of the destruction of the heathen and the reconquest of Shimeh.  But there were a great many mercenaries such as myself, and like myself, they inadvertently furthered the Holy War by killing their fair share of heathen.  The failure of the Holy War had nothing to do with us.&lt;br /&gt;Did I say failure?  Perhaps “transformation” would be a better word.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

Faith is the truth of passion.  Since no passion is more true than another, faith is the truth of nothing.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE FOURTH ANALYTIC OF MAN

==Chapter Sixteen – Momemn==

Those of us who survived will always be bewildered when we recall his arrival.  And not just because he was so different then.  In a strange sense he never changed.  We changed.  If he seems so different to us now, it is because he was the figure that transformed the ground.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Seventeen – The Andiamine Heights==

The event itself was unprecedented: not since the fall of Cenei to the Scylvendi hordes had so many potentates gathered in one place.  But few knew Mankind itself lay upon the balance.  And who could guess that a brief exchange of glances, not the Shriah’s edict, would tip the balance?&lt;br /&gt;But is this not the very enigma of history?  When one peers deep enough, one always finds that catastrophe and triumph, the proper objects of the historian’s scrutiny, inevitably turn upon the small, the trivial, the nightmarishly accidental.  When I reflect overmuch on this fact, I do not fear that we are “drunks at the sacred dance,” as Protathis writes, but that there is no dance at all.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Eighteen – The Andiamine Heights==

. . . and that revelation murdered all that I once did know.  Where once I asked of the God, “Who are you?” now I ask, “Who am I?”&lt;br /&gt;—ANKHARLUS, LETTER TO THE WHITE TEMPLE

The Emperor, the consensus seems to be, was an excessively suspicious man.  Fear has many forms, but it is never so dangerous as when it is combined with power and perpetual uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

==Chapter Nineteen – Momemn==

. . . even though the skin-spies were exposed relatively early in the course of the Holy War, most believed the Cishaurim rather than the Consult to be responsible.  This is the problem of all great revelations: their significance so often exceeds the frame of our comprehension.  We understand only after, always after.  Not simply when it is too late, but precisely because it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Here we see philosophy brought to what is, in fact, a precarious position, which should be made fast even though it is supported by nothing in either heaven or earth.

All the contingents, the Conriyans, the Galeoth, the Nansur, the Thunyeri, the Tydonni, the Ainoni, and the Scarlet Spires, marched to the fortress of Asgilioch, to the Southron Gates and the heathen frontier.  And though many bent their thoughts to Skauras, the heathen Sapatishah who would contest us, he was still woven of the same cloth as a thousand other abstract concerns.  Once could still confuse war with everyday living …&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;No decision is so fine as to not bind us to its consequences.&lt;br /&gt;No consequence is so unexpected as to absolve us of our decisions.&lt;br /&gt;Not even death.&lt;br /&gt;—XIUS, THE TRUCIAN DRAMAS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It seems a strange thing to recall these events, like walking to find I had narrowly missed a fatal fall in the darkness.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Every monumental work of the State is measured by cubits.  Every cubit is measured by the length of the Aspect-Emperor’s arm.  And the Aspect-Emperor’s arm, they say, stands beyond measure.  But I say the Aspect-Emperor’s arm is measured by the length of a cubit, and that all cubits are measured by the works of the State.  Not even the All stands beyond measure, for it is more than what lies within it, and “more” is a kind of measure.  Even the God has His cubits.&lt;br /&gt;—IMPARRHAS, PSÜKALOGUES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If one doubts that passion and unreason govern the fate of nations, one need only look to meetings between the Great.  Kings and emperors are unused to treating with equals, and are often excessively relieved or repelled as a result.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;How does one learn innocence?  How does one teach ignorance?  For to be them is to know them not.

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If all human events possess purpose, then all human deeds possess purpose.  And yet when men vie with men, the purpose of no man comes to fruition: the result always falls somewhere in between.  The purpose of deeds, then, cannot derive from the purposes of men, because all men vie with all men.  This means the deeds of men must be willed by something other than men.  From this it follows that we are all slaves.&lt;br /&gt;Who then is our Master?&lt;br /&gt;—MEMGOWA, THE BOOK OF DIVINE ACTS&lt;/p&gt;

Should I, like my grandfather, knock such childishness from them?  Or should I indulge their delusions?  Even now, as death’s shadowy pickets gather about me, I ask, Why should innocence answer to the world? Perhaps the world should answer to innocence…&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I rather like that.

In pursuing yonder what they have lost, they encounter only the nothing they have.  In order not to lose touch with the everyday dreariness in which, as irremediable realists, they are at home, they adapt the meaning they revel in to the meaninglessness they flee.

In the skins of elk I pass over grasses.  Rain falls, and I cleanse my face in the sky.  I hear the Horse Prayers spoken, but my lips are far away.

==Chapter Ten: Xerash==

Souls can no more see the origins of their thought than they can see the backs of their heads or the insides of their entrails.  And since souls cannot differentiate what they cannot see, there is a peculiar sense in which the soul cannot self-differentiate.  So it is always, in a peculiar sense, the same time when they think, the same place where they think, and the same individual who does the thinking.  Like tipping a spiral on its side until only a circle can be seen, the passage of moments always remains now, the carnival of spaces always sojourns here, and the succession of people always becomes me.  The truth is, if the soul could apprehend itself the way it apprehended the world—if it could apprehend its origins—it would see that there is no now, there is no here, and there is no me.  In other words, it would realize that just as there is no circle, there is no soul.&lt;br /&gt;—MEMGOWA, CELESTIAL APHORISMS

Of all the Cants, none better illustrates the nature of the soul than the Cants of Compulsion.  According to Zarathinius, the fact that those compelled unerringly think themselves free shows that Volition is one more thing moved in the soul, and not the mover we take it to be.

==Chapter Twelve: Holy Amoteu==

Death, in the strict sense, cannot be defined, for whatever predicate we, the living, attribute to it necessarily belongs to Life.  This means that Death, as a category, behaves in a manner indistinguishable from the Infinite, and from God.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

One cannot assume the truth of what one declares without presuming the falsity of all incongruous declarations.  Since all men assume the truth of their declarations, this presumption becomes at best ironic and at worst outrageous.  Given the infinity of possible claims, who could be so vain as to think their dismal claims true?  The tragedy, of course, is that we cannot but make declarations.  So it seems we must speak as Gods to converse as Men.&lt;br /&gt;—HATATIAN, EXHORTATIONS

Faith, they say, is simply hope confused for knowledge.  Why believe when hope alone is enough?&lt;br /&gt;—CRATIANAS, NILNAMESHI LORE

Ajencis, in the end, argued that ignorance was the only absolute.  According to Parcis, he would tell his students that he knew only that he knew more than when he was an infant.  This comparative assertion was the only nail, he would say, to which one could tie the carpenter-string of knowledge.  This has come down to us as the famed “Ajencian Nail,” and it is the only thing that prevented the Great Kyranean from falling into the tail-chasing scepticism of Nirsolfa, or the embarrassing dogmatism of well-nigh every philosopher and theologian who ever dared scratch ink across parchment.&lt;br /&gt;But even this metaphor, “nail,” is faulty, a result of what happens when we confuse our notation with what is noted.  Like the numeral “zero” used by the Nilnameshi mathematicians to work such wonders, ignorance is the occluded frame of all discourse, the unseen circumference of our every contention.  Men are forever looking for the one point, the singular fulcrum they can use to dislodge all competing claims.  Ignorance does not give us this.  What it provides, rather, is the possibility of comparison, the assurance that not all claims are equal.  And this, Ajencis would argue, is all that we need.  For so long as we admit our ignorance, we can hope to improve our claims, and so long as we can improve our claims, we can aspire to the Truth, even if only in rank approximation.&lt;br /&gt;And this is why I mourn my love of the Great Kyranean.  For despite the pull of his wisdom, there are many things of which I am absolutely certain, things that feed the hate which drives this very quill.&lt;br /&gt;—DRUSAS ACHAMIAN, COMPENDIUM OF THE FIRST HOLY WAR

But who are you, man, to answer God thus?  Will what is made say to him who made it—Why have you made me this way?  Does the potter not have power over his clay, to make, from the same mass, one vessel for honour, and another for dishonour?&lt;br /&gt;—ROMANS 9:20-21

==Prologue:==

When a man possesses the innocence of a child, we call him a fool.  When a child possesses the cunning of a man, we call him an abomination.  As with love, knowledge has its season.

==Chapter One: Sakarpus==

upon the high wall the husbands slept,&lt;br /&gt;while ’round the hearth their women wept,&lt;br /&gt;and fugitives murmured tales of woe,&lt;br /&gt;of greater cities lost to Mog-Pharau …&lt;br /&gt;—“THE REFUGEE’S SONG,” THE SAGAS

==Chapter Two: Hûnoreal==

We burn like over-fat candles, our centres gouged, our edges curling in, our wick forever outrunning our wax.  We resemble what we are: Men who never sleep.&lt;br /&gt;—ANONYMOUS MANDATE SCHOOLMAN, THE HEIROMANTIC PRIMER

==Chapter Three: Momemn==

On my knees, I offer you that which flies in me.  My face to earth, I shout your glory to the heavens.  In so surrendering do I conquer.  In so yielding do I seize.&lt;br /&gt;—NEL-SARIPAL, DEDICATION TO MONIUS

==Chapter Four: Hûnoreal==

For He sees gold in the wretched and excrement in the exalted.  Nay, the world is not equal in the eyes of the God.&lt;br /&gt;—SCHOLARS, 7:16, THE TRACTATE

==Chapter Five: Momemn==

Where luck is the twist of events relative to mortal hope, White-Luck is the twist of events relative to divine desire.  To worship it is to simply will what happens as it happens.&lt;br /&gt;—ARS SIBBUL, SIX ONTONOMIES

==Chapter Six: Marrow==

Ask the dead and they will tell you.  All roads are not equal.  Verily, even maps can sin.&lt;br /&gt;—EKYANNUS, 44 EPISTLES

What the world merely kills, Men murder.&lt;br /&gt;—SCYLVENDI PROVERB

==Chapter Seven: Sakarpus==

… conquered peoples live and die with the knowledge that survival does not suffer honour.  They have chosen shame over the pyre, the slow flame for the quick. &lt;br /&gt;—TRIAMIS I, JOURNALS AND DIALOGUES

==Chapter Eight: The River Rohil==

The will to conceal and the will to deceive are one and the same.  Verily, a secret is naught but a deception that goes unspoken.  A lie that only the Gods can hear.&lt;br /&gt;—MEREMPOMPAS, EPISTEMATA

==Chapter Nine: Momemn==

A beggar’s mistake harms no one but the beggar.  A king’s mistake, however, harms everyone but the king.  Too often, the measure of power lies not in the number who obey your will, but in the number who suffer your stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;—TRIAMIS I, JOURNALS AND DIALOGUES

==Chapter Ten: Condia==

Look unto other and ponder the sin and folly you find there.  For their sin is your sin, and their folly is your folly.  Seek ye the true reflecting pool?  Look to the stranger you despites, not the friend you love.&lt;br /&gt;—TRIBES 6:42, THE CHRONICLE OF THE TUSK

==Chapter Eleven: The Osthwai Mountains==

Since all men count themselves righteous, and since no righteous man raises his hand against the innocent, a man need only strike another to make him evil.&lt;br /&gt;—NULLA VOGNEAS, THE CYNICATA

Where two reasons may deliver truth, a thousand lead to certain delusion.  The more steps you take, the more likely you will wander astray.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THEOPHYSICS

==Chapter Twelve: The Andiamine Heights==

Little snake, what poison in your bite!&lt;br /&gt;Little snake, what fear you should strike!&lt;br /&gt;But they don’t know, little snake—oh no!&lt;br /&gt;They can’t see the tiny places you go…&lt;br /&gt;—ZEÜMI NURSERY SONG

==Chapter Thirteen: Condia==

Damnation follows not from the bare utterance of sorcery, for nothing is bare in this world.  No act is so wicked, no abomination is so obscene, as to lie beyond the salvation of my Name.&lt;br /&gt;—ANASÛRIMBOR KELLHUS, NOVUM ARCANUM

==Chapter Fourteen: Cil-Aujus==

The world is only as deep as we can see.  This is why fools think themselves profound.  This is why terror is the passion of revelation.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

==Chapter Fifteen: Condia==

If the immutable appears recast, then you yourself have been transformed.&lt;br /&gt;—MEMGOWA, CELESTIAL APHORISMS

==Chapter Sixteen: Cil-Aujus==

A soul too far wandered from the sun,&lt;br /&gt;walking deeper ways,&lt;br /&gt;into regions beneath map and nation,&lt;br /&gt;breathing air drawn for the dead,&lt;br /&gt;talking of lamentation.&lt;br /&gt;—PROTATHIS, THE GOAT’S HEART

The heavens, the sun, the whole of nature is a corpse.  Nature is given over to the spiritual, and indeed to spiritual subjectivity, thus the course of nature is everywhere broken in upon by miracles.&lt;br /&gt;—HEGEL, LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY III

==Chapter One: The Meorn Wilderness==

Without rules, madness.  Without discipline, death.&lt;br /&gt;—NANSUR MILITARY MARCH

==Chapter Two: The Istyuli Plains==

We belittle what we cannot bear.  We make figments out of fundamentals, all in the name of preserving our own peculiar fancies.  The best way to secure one’s own deception is to accuse others of deceit.&lt;br /&gt;—HATATIAN, EXHORTATIONS

It is not so much the wisdom of the wise that saves us from the foolishness of the fools as it is the latter’s inability to agree.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

==Chapter Three: The Meorn Wilderness==

The bondage we are born into is the bondage we cannot see.  Verily, freedom is little more than the ignorance of tyranny.  Live long enough, and you will see: Men resent not the whip so much as the hand that wields it.&lt;br /&gt;—TRIAMIS I, JOURNALS AND DIALOGUES

==Chapter Four: The Istyuli Plains==

All ropes come up short if pulled long enough.  All futures end in tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;—CENEIAN PROVERB

And they forged counterfeits from our frame, creatures vile and obscene, who hungered only for violent congress.  These beasts they loosed upon the land, where they multiplied, no matter how fierce the Ishroi who hunted them.  And soon Men clamoured at our gates, begging sanctuary, for they could not contend with the creatures.  “They wear your face,” the penitents cried. “This calamity is your issue.” But we were wroth, and turned them away, saying, “These are not our Sons.  And you are not our Brothers.”&lt;br /&gt;—ISÛPHIRYAS

==Chapter Five: The Western Three Seas==

As death is the sum of all harms, so is murder the sum of all sins.&lt;br /&gt;—CANTICLES 18:9, THE CHRONICLE OF THE TUSK

The world has its own ways, sockets so deep that not even the Gods can dislodge them.  No urn is so cracked as Fate.&lt;br /&gt;—ASANSIUS, THE LIMPING PILGRIM

==Chapter Six: The Meorn Wilderness==

Everything is concealed always.  Nothing is more trite than a mask.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

If you find yourself taken unawares by someone you thought you knew, recall that the character revealed is as much your own as otherwise.  When it comes to Men and their myriad, mercenary natures, revelation always comes in twos.&lt;br /&gt;—MANAGORAS, ODE TO THE LONG-LIVED FOOL

==Chapter Seven: The Istyuli Plains==

... and they scoff at heroes, saying that Fate serves disaster to many, and feasts to few.  They claim that willing is but a form of blindness, and conceit of beggars who think they wrest alms from the jaws of lions.  The Whore alone, they say, decides who is brave and who is rash, who will be hero and who will be fool.  And so they dwell in a world of victims.&lt;br /&gt;—QUALLAS, ON THE INVITIC SAGES

Ever do Men use secrets to sort and measure those they love, which is why they are less honest with their brothers and more guarded with their friends.&lt;br /&gt;—CASIDAS, ANNALS OF CENEI

==Chapter Twelve: Kûniüri==

Skies are upended, poured as milk into the tar of night.  Cities become pits of fire.  The last of the wicked stand with the last of the righteous, lamenting the same woe.

Know what your slaves believe, and you will always be their master.&lt;br /&gt;—AINONI PROVERB

==Chapter Thirteen: The Istyuli Plains==

Gods are epochal beings, not quite alive.  Since the Now eludes them, they are forever divided.  Sometimes nothing blinds souls more profoundly than the apprehension of the Whole.  Men need recall this when they pray. &lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN

==Chapter Fourteen: Momemn==

The truth of all polity lies in the ruins of previous ages, for there we see the ultimate sum of avarice and ambition.  Seek ye to rule for but a day, because little more shall be afforded you.  As the Siqû are fond of saying, Cû’jara Cinmoi is dead.&lt;br /&gt;—GOTAGGA, PARAPOLIS

Any fool can see the limits of seeing, but not even the wisest know the limits of knowing.  Thus is ignorance rendered invisible, and are all Men made fools.&lt;br /&gt;—AJENCIS, THE THIRD ANALYTIC OF MEN.

==Chapter Fifteen: The Library of Sauglish==

In life, your soul is but the extension of your body, which reaches inward until it finds its centre in spirit.  In death, your body is but the extension of your soul, which reaches outward until it finds it circumference in flesh.  In both instances, all things appear the same.  Thus are the dead and the living confused.&lt;br /&gt;—MEMGOWA, THE BOOK OF DIVINE ACTS

Yet the soul lingers like a second smell&lt;br /&gt;A sailor wrecked at sea, it clings&lt;br /&gt;Lest it sink and drown in Hell.&lt;br /&gt;—GIRGALLA, EPIC OF SAUGLISH

==Interlude: Ishuäl==

The heroes among us, they are the true slaves.  Thrust against the limits of mortality, they alone feel the bite of their shackles.  So they rage.  So they fight.&lt;br /&gt;We only have as much freedom as we have slack in our chains.  Only those who dare nothing are truly free.&lt;br /&gt;—SUÖRTAGAL, EPIMEDITATIONS

==Summary==
{{Blockquote|There are three, and only three, kinds of men in the world: cynics, fanatics, and Mandate Schoolmen.|[[Ontillas]], On the Folly of Men}}

{{Blockquote|The author has often observed that in the genesis of great events, men generally possess no inkling of what their actions portend. This problem is not, as one might suppose, a result of men’s blindness to the consequences of their actions. Rather it is a result of the mad way the dreadful turns on the trivial when the ends of one man cross the ends of another. The Schoolmen of the Scarlet Spires have an old saying: “When one man chases a hare, he finds a hare. But when many men chase a hare, they find a dragon.” In the prosecution of competing human interests, the result is always unknown, and all too often terrifying.|[[Drusas Achamian]], [[Compendium of the First Holy War]]}}

'''Midwinter, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], [[Carythusal]]'''

[[Drusas Achamian]], a [[Mandate]] [[sorcerer]] and spy meets with [[Geshrunni]], a captain of the [[Scarlet Spires]]’ warrior-slaves, the [[Javreh]] in a tavern in the [[High Ainon|Ainoni]] city of [[Carythusal]]. Geshrunni reveals that he knows Achamian is a sorcerer. Achamian, thinking that he’s about to be exposed prepares to unleash his [[sorcery]], but Geshrunni produces a [[Chorae]], a small anti-magic sphere. Achamian realizes that Geshrunni is on his own at the tavern and admits to being a spy for the [[The Schools|School]] of Mandate and asks Geshrunni what he wants, to which the Captain replies that he wants “Truth.” In the end, Geshrunni releases Achamian and agrees to spy for him on the Scarlet Spires.

Geshrunni reveals to Achamian that ten years previously, the [[Cishaurim]], the Sorcerer-Priests of the [[Fanimry|Fanim]], assassinated the Grandmaster of the Scarlet Spires, [[Sasheoka]]. The meeting ends and while Geshrunni is walking home he realizes that he’s being followed and tries to ambush his follower. He throws a Chorae at the man thinking that he’s a Scarlet Spires sorcerer, but the man catches the Chorae and is not affected by it. Geshrunni is struck and falls down hard. He watches the man’s face loosen, then flex.

Back at his room, Achamian is having a [[Seswatha’s Dreams|Seswatha’s Dream]], he is witnessing events from 2,000 years prior. [[Seswatha]] fought the [[No-God]] during the [[Apocalypse]] where he witnessed the death of [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], High King of [[Kûniüri]]. With his dying wrods, Celmomas prophesied the return an Anasûrimbor “at the end of the world.” Achamian awakens weeping.

Geshrunni, having been tortured by the [[skin-spies|skin-spy]] and confessed all he knows, now seems to be missing his face and gets thrown him in a river to drown. The next morning, Achamian uses the [[Cants of Calling]] to communicate with [[Atyersus]], the citadel of the Mandate. He’s ordered to return home due to a matter involving the [[Thousand Temples]].

{{Blockquote|I write to inform you that during my most recent audience, the Nansur Emperor, quite without provocation, publicly addressed me as “fool.” You are, no doubt, unmoved by this. It has become a common occurrence. The Consult eludes us now more than ever. We hear them only in the secrets of others. We glimpse them only through the eyes of those who deny their very existence. Why should we not be called fools? The deeper the Consult secretes itself among the Great Factions, the madder our rantings sound to their ears. We are, as the damned Nansur would say, “a hunter in the thicket”—one who, by the very act of hunting, extinguishes all hope of running down his prey.|Anonymous Mandate Schoolman, Letter to Atyersus}}

'''Late Winter, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], [[Atyersus]]'''

At Atyersus, [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] is called before the [[Mandate]] Quorum, where he’s informed that the new [[Shriah]] of the [[Thousand Temples]], [[Maithanet]], has called for a [[Holy War]]. The target of the Holy War is not yet known but they speculate that it is either the [[The Schools|Schools]] or the [[Fanimry|Fanim]]. [[Polchias Simas|Simas]], an old teacher of Achamian councils that a Holy War against the Fanim and their sorcerous priests, the [[Cishaurim]], could not succeed. Therefore the target has to be the Schools.

Achamian is ordered to go to [[Sumna]] and discover Maithanet’s true intent. He claims that he has no more contacts in Sumna but he remembers [[Esmenet]], a whore he used to visit. And there is also someone else. Simas has informed [[Seidru Nautzera|Nautzera]], a senior member of the Quorum, that Achamian does have an asset in Sumna: [[Paro Inrau|Inrau]], a young priest. Inrau was once Achamian’s student, but he defected from the Mandate. Achamian objects but Nautzera reminds him that Inrau should have been eliminated for compromising the [[Gnosis]]. Achamian, who helped Inrau escape, is blackmailed into using him as an informant. He reluctantly agrees and leaves for Sumna.

At a private meeting between Simas and Nautzera, we are informed that the Mandate’s agents are being eliminated. Nautzera wanted to tell Achamian of that fact but Simas told him it would only ensure that he would refuse to seek out Inrau. They conclude that, since their spies are taken out so effortlessly, there must be a traitor amongst the Mandate.

The '''Day Lantern''', also called the '''Diurnal''', '''Sky Lantern''' or '''False Sun''', is a sorcerous artifact, a fan of mirrors that reflects the Sun even in the deepest night. It is one of the [[Sublime Contrivances]] of the Artisan, [[Emilidis]].&lt;ref name=fs&gt;[http://www.rscottbakker.com/atrocity-tales/the-false-sun/ The False Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilidis of [[Ishoriöl]], greatest of the [[Nonmen]] sorcerer-artisans, created the Day Lantern during the war between [[Nihrimsul]] and [[Siöl]] that erupted in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]]. Emilidis gifted the artifact to King [[Sin’niroiha]] of Nihrimsul, who used it to win an alliance with Ishoriöl. With the announcement of this alliance, King [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] sued for peace, declaring that a "King of Three Mansions may be brother to a King of two".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Emilidis'&lt;/ref&gt;

The Day Lantern was then deployed as a weapon during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], used to pierce the darkest hiding places of the foe and to dismay [[Sranc]], which preferred to fight in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Diurnal'&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s last known carrier was [[Titirga]], who carried it with him to his death in [[Viri]] at the hands of [[Shaeönanra]] and [[Aurang]]. The fate of the Day Lantern after this point is unknown.&lt;ref name=fs /&gt;

==Summary==
{{Blockquote|If the world is a game whose rules are written by the God, and sorcerers are those who cheat and cheat, then who has written the rules of sorcery?|Zarathinius, A Defence of the Arcane Arts}}

'''Early Spring, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], En Route to [[Sumna]]'''

On a boat sailing across the [[Meneanor|Meneanor Sea]] to Sumna, [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] awakens from a [[Seswatha’s Dreams|Seswatha Dream]]. He dreamed of the dragon [[Skafra]]. On the deck, [[Nron]]i sailors pray to the God of dice, [[Momas]], Aspect of storm and sea.

The boat reaches the harbour of Sumna, and from its railing Achamian muses about the [[Hagerna]], which forms the administrative centre of the [[Thousand Temples]]; and the [[Junriüma]], the holy shrine where the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]] rests. He remembers his former student [[Paro Inrau|Inrau]] and the excessive enthusiasm with which he spoke of the Hagerna. He realizes that [[Maithanet]] should be feared because he carries a “plague whose primary symptom is certainty.” The captain of the ship joins him at the railing and warns him that [[Sorcerer]]s are not welcome in Sumna, the holiest city of [[Inrithism]]. The Inrithi view sorcerers as heretics and sinners. Achamian remembers himself as a child and the first time he “experienced” seeing the [[onta]], the very fabric of existence which only the [[Few]] could see. He thinks about the [[Mandate]] and how its hated by the other [[the Schools|Schools]] for its possession of the [[Gnosis]], the [[sorcery]] of the [[Nonmen]] of the [[Ancient North]].

He walks through the city and thinks about the Tusk. The Tusk is the most ancient human text in [[Eärwa]], and the premier Holy artifact of Inrithism. It had always been installed in Sumna, making it the Holiest city in Inrithi tradition. He stumbles onto a crowd and discovers that Maithanet has called the faithful to reveal the object of the [[Holy War]]. He realizes that the Mandate Quorum must have known this and purposefully hid it from him to manipulate him into going to Sumna.

In bed with a prostitute named [[Esmenet]], Achamian experiences the Fevers again; a disease that possessed him six years ago and almost killed him. Esmenet bitterly says that her [[Mimara|daughter]] died that same year. He confides in her his plans to turn Inrau and says that she must find him the following day. Esmenet says the two of them, harlot and sorcerer, make a sad couple.

Achamian finds Inrau in a tavern the next morning and greets him. Inrau is startled and notices the Shrial Knights nearby. He thinks it’s good to see Achamian and remembers that he regretted leaving the Mandate for some time. Achamian tells Inrau that he’s been sent to spy on Maithanet. Inrau reminds Achamian that he promised to leave him alone and Achamian tearfully says that the world has a habit of breaking the back of his promises.

The two argue for a while until they are interrupted by a Shrial Knight called [[Cutias Sarcellus|Sarcellus]]. Pretending to be Inrau’s drunk uncle, Achamian provokes Sarcellus and then falls to the ground when the latter slaps him. The tavern erupts and Sarcellus leaves them.

Later, Achamian is standing in the central square of the Hagerna among a great crowd, he’s waiting for Maithanet to declare the target of the Holy War. Maithanet appears and denounces [[Fanimry]] as an affront to the [[God of Gods|God]], and the [[Kian]]ene followers of a [[Fane|False Prophet]] and an obscene race. Achamian is moved to delirious wonder by the man’s voice and his Fever strikes him again. Maithanet continues on to declare the object of the Holy Way is to free the Holy city of [[Shimeh]], the birth place of the [[Inri Sejenus|Latter Prophet]], from the hands of the Kianene and their [[Cishaurim]] priests. Achamian wonders why Maithanet would declare a war that could not be won. He becomes delirious and the crowd lifts him thinking he’s having a religious experience. He’s recognized by another former student of his, Prince [[Nersei Proyas]] of [[Conriya]]. Before the two can speak Maithanet comes before Achamian and tells him that his kind are not welcome there. Achamian flees realizing that Maithanet is one of the Few.

Proyas is outraged at seeing Achamian in the Holy city even though he once loved him. He is led to the Tusk by [[Incheiri Gotian]], the Grandmaster of the Shrial Knights. He prays before Maithanet joins him and asks who it had been that dared to pollute his presence, referring to Achamian.

In the [[Three Seas]], the Cults have been administratively and spiritually subordinate to the [[Thousand Temples]] since [[Triamis the Great|Triamis I]], the first [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] of Cenei, declared [[Inrithism]] the official state religion of the [[Ceneian Empire]] in 2505.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Cults'&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Cult traditionally keeps indexes called Omen texts, detailing the various omens and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Omen-Texts'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">'''Zealot Wars''' was the prolonged religious conflict (c. 2390-2478) between the early [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] and the [[Kiünnat]], which eventually led to the ascendancy of the [[Thousand Temples]] in the [[Three Seas]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Zealot Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the alleged ascension of [[Inri Sejenus]], Inrithism slowly established itself throughout the [[Ceneian Empire]] as an organized hierarchy independent of the state—what came to be called the Thousand Temples. Initially, the existing traditionalist Kiünnat sects simply dismissed the new religion, but as it continued to grow, a number of attempts were made to circumscribe its powers and prevent its further spread, none of them particularly effective. Escalating tensions eventually culminated in the Zealot Wars, which, although technically a civil war, saw battles fought far outside the boundaries of what then constituted the Ceneian Empire.

In 2469, [[Sumna]] capitulated to Shrial forces, but hostilities continued until [[Triamis the Great]] was anointed Emperor in 2478. Though himself Inrithi (converted by [[Ekyannus III]]), and despite enacting the constitution governing the division of powers between the Imperium and the Thousand Temples, he refrained from declaring Inrithism the official state religion until 2505. From that point the ascendancy of the Thousand Temples was assured, and over the ensuing centuries the remaining Kiünnat “heresies” of the Three Seas would either wither away or be forcibly stamped out.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Inrithism’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1606">'''Nihrimsul''' was an ancient [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Mansion]] that once was subdued by [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]. Its King, [[Sin’niroiha]] (“First Among Peoples” in Ihrimsû), was forced to wash the sword of the High King of [[Siöl]].

After the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], emboldened by Siöl’s distraction, Nihrimsul and [[Cil-Aujas]] had revolted.

After years of hard campaigning, Cû’jara-Cinmoi finally brought the [[Ishroi]] of Cil-Aujas to heel, but King Sin’niroiha and the Ishroi of Nihrimsul continued to resist him. The ''[[Isûphiryas]]'' chronicles dozens of bloody yet indecisive confrontations between the two Kings: the Battle of Ciphara, the Battle of Hilcyri, the Siege of Asargoi. Proud beyond reason, Cû’jara-Cinmoi refused to relent, and put to death every embassy Sin’niroiha sent to him. Only when Sin’niroiha became King of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]] through marriage did the High King of Siöl concede. “A King of Three Mansions,” he is said to have declared, “may be Brother to a King of Two.”&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

Nihrimsul was founded by the first generation of Nonmen in recorded history, separately and independently of Siöl. For this reason, Nihrimsul disputed Siöl's claim to be the "House Primordial", leading to their later strife and the [[Thousand Year Siege]]. Nihrimsul was located under a southern spur of the [[Yimaleti Mountains]], in the eastern part of the range, east of [[Viri]] and west of Siöl.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Nihrimsul'&lt;/ref&gt;

It's a fan constructed forum dedicated exclusevly to all things R. Scott Bakker, especially his Second Apocalypse series.



If you are looking for information about the books, you might check out the extensive PoN Almanac that the community has put together ( http://second-apocalypse.com/index.php?board=19.0 ). It has entries of decent lengh that summarize each chapter of the first book which may prove useful if you plan on continuing to build this wikia (btw, great job)&lt;ac_metadata title="The Second Apocalypse forum"&gt; &lt;/ac_metadata&gt;</text>

== Title of this wikia ==

Not sure where to put this, but the title of this wikia "Prince of Nothing' no longer makes sense. Not sure if it can be changed, but if the intent is to include all works (including the 2nd series Aspect Emporer, and the rumored 3rd series which is yet unnamed) then it should really be called "The Second Apocalypse".

Prince of Nothing is specifically the title of the original trillogy, and may cause confusion in the future if left unchanged. Worse yet, it might lead to someone trying to make an all inclusive wikia under that name, and then the community, such as it is, would be wasting its time double posting content to both.

{{unsigned|Anasurimbor_Wilshire}}

: I think there is actually a wiki called the Second Apocalypse with some of the same content that's here... Though it doesn't look like anyone is updating it. I don't think this is a big problem but wiki titles cannot be changed as far as I know except by submitting a request to Wikia staff and they might do it.

:I hope you are correct. Perhaps those of you who are major contributors over here should try to contact those few who build the second apocalypse wikia, so you can try and merge the sites and try to reduce redundancy. Just a thought...

{{unsigned|Anasurimbor_Wilshire}}, June 6, 2014

:Yeah, two wikis with the same content is really a bad idea. But merging wikia sites isn't possible, nor is deleting them, not even by the creators.
:[[User:Neorem|Neorem]] ([[User talk:Neorem|talk]]) 09:45, June 22, 2014 (UTC)

I don't know how to edit wikis...I found some glaring problems with the cover art for the series. For each of the first tree books the cover art is of very shitty quality.

The 3 hiqh quality cover arts can be found here, directly on the Amazon website. Someone please add them to the individual articles.

'''Naree''' is a [[Nilnamesh | Nilnameshi]] Prostitute. She has a beautiful and dark face. As of the year 4132, Naree did not know her age, only that five years had passed since her flowering.

==Story==
Naree was raised a [[yitarissa]], a ritual harem-slave popular among the Nilnameshi [[caste]]-nobility. Her owner possessed estates both in [[Invishi]], where they wintered, and in the [[Hinayati Mountains]], where they spent the plague months of summer. He was a gentle man and she loved him.

However, when her first bleeding came, rather than sell her to a brothel, as was the fate of most yitarissa, her owner set her free. Almost immediately she became the mistress of another caste-noble, a trade representative who was sent to [[Momemn]] four years prior. He was the one who had purchased the yellow room and its sumptuous furnishings. Naree loved him as well, but when his year-long tenure expired, he simply moved his wife and household back to Invishi without saying a word. She began selling afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;
===''The White-Luck Warrior''===
When [[Maithanet]] takes over the [[Andiamine Heights]], [[Imhailas]] takes Esmenet to hide in Naree's room where she works. While she's there Naree is visited by four different men.
Out of fear for Imhailas' life, Naree begs Esmenet to find another place to hide.

Imhailas returns and strikes Naree when he finds out that she's been taking custom in front of the Empress. He threatens to
kill her but Esmenet reminds him that she had been a whore as well. Naree continues to take custom.

When the Shrial Knights arrive to take Esmenet they kill Imhailas, and one of them,
a [[Collegian]], gives Naree five gold kellics and a silver to ''remember'' Esmenet by.&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gin’gûrima''' was the greatest [[Nonmen|Nonman]] Hero of the ancient Mansion of [[Viri]]. He was the first to turn on [[Nin’janjin]] and his [[Inchoroi]] allies at the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]].

Gin’gûrima was killed by a [[Wracu|Dragon]] on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]] during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2351">'''Viri''' was one of the Nine High Mansions of [[Eärwa]]. It was located in the [[Urokka Mountains]] north of the Sea of [[Neleöst]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Isûphiryas]],'' the [[Incû-Holoinas]], plunged to earth to the west of the [[Neleöst|Sea of Neleöst]] in land ruled by [[Nin’janjin]], the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] King of Viri. The fall of the Ark-of-the-Skies caused a natural disaster and sent up ash-clouds that darkened the skies, resulting in a famine.

Nin’janjin begged [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], the King of [[Siöl]] for help. Rather than send aid to Nin’janjin, Cû’jara-Cinmoi assembled an army and invaded the lands of Viri. Nin’janjin and his [[Ishroi]] capitulated without battle; Viri became a bloodless tributary of Siöl.

Many years later embassy of [[Inchoroi]] reached Nin’janjin at Viri. They reminded Nin’janjin of Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s treachery in his time of need, and offered an alliance to break the yoke of Siöl over Viri. Despite the warnings of his Ishroi, Nin’janjin accepted the Inchoroi terms. Viri revolted. The Siölan Ishroi within its halls were slain; the rest were enslaved.

[[Sil]], the Inchoroi King, and Nin’janjin assembled their hosts to meet Cû’jara-Cinmoi on the [[Fields of Eleneöt|Fields of Pir Pahal]], which [[Men]] would call Eleneöt in a later age. According to the ''Isûphiryas,'' the Nonmen of Viri were dismayed by the sight of their allies, who wore fierce and festering bodies as garments of war.

[[Gin’gûrima]], the greatest hero among them, pointed to Nin’janjin and declared, “Hate has blinded him.” This treason within a treason was repeated by others, until it became a thundering chorus. Nin’janjin fled, seeking protection from Sil. The Inchoroi then turned upon their allies, hoping to destroy the host of Viri before Cû’jara-Cinmoi and the great host of Siöl could close with them.

Overmatched by the Inchoroi and their weapons of light, the Nonmen of Viri were driven back with horrendous losses. Only Cû’jara-Cinmoi and his Ishroi Chariots saved them from utter destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;

In later epochs, the great fortress of [[Dagliash]] was built atop the ruins of Viri.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sin’niroiha''' (“First Among Peoples” in Ihrimsû), was the High King of the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Mansion]] of [[Nihrimsul]].

For millennia, Nihrimsul and [[Siöl]] feuded over their respective claims to be the House Primordial of the Nonmen. Nihrimsul endured the [[Thousand Year Siege]] and other conflicts, and survived each time. Some time before [[Arkfall]] Sin’niroiha inherited the rule of the mansion and defied [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]'s power.

In the wake of Arkfall, Siöl conquered [[Viri]] and was able to seize Nihrimsul and [[Cil-Aujas]] by force of arms. A defeated Sin’niroiha was forced to wash the sword of the High King of Siöl as an act of supplication.

After the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], emboldened by Siöl’s distraction, Nihrimsul and [[Cil-Aujas]] revolted under Sin’niroiha's leadership.

After years of hard campaigning, Cû’jara-Cinmoi finally brought the [[Ishroi]] of Cil-Aujas to heel, but King Sin’niroiha and the Ishroi of Nihrimsul continued to resist him. The ''[[Isûphiryas]]'' chronicles dozens of bloody yet indecisive confrontations between the two Kings: the Battle of Ciphara, the Battle of Hilcyri and the Siege of Asargoi. Proud beyond reason, Cû’jara-Cinmoi refused to relent, and put to death every embassy Sin’niroiha sent to him.{{EG|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars}}

Nihrimsul's hopes in the conflict were few; although well-defended, the Mansion had long irked the other mansions (all descended from the [[House of Tsonos]]) and without allies it could not endure against the combined might of Siöl, Viri and Cil-Aujas. However, Sin’niroiha won a tremendous boon when [[Emilidis]] gifted him with a gift beyond compare: the fabled [[False Sun|Day Lantern]]. With this boon, Sin’niroiha won the alliance of [[Ishoriöl]] and the hand of [[Tsinirû]] in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Emilidis'&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus did Sin’niroiha become High King of Ishoriöl and Nihrimsul together, and removed his court to Ishoriöl. Perhaps wary of their combined strength (Ishoriöl was mighty in power), the King of Siöl conceded to peace. “A King of Three Mansions,” he is said to have declared, “may be Brother to a King of Two.”{{EG|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars}}

In the following years, Sin’niroiha and Tsinirû had a son, [[Nil'giccas]]. Sin’niroiha grew older, like Cû’jara-Cinmoi, and his mortality approached. However, where Cû’jara-Cinmoi accepted the [[Inchoroi]] treatment against death - the [[Inoculation]] - Sin’niroiha refused it, but did not bar his followers or his family from accepting it.

When the [[Womb Plague]] struck down all of the Nonmen women (presumably including Tsinirû), Sin’niroiha made common cause and alliance with Cû’jara-Cinmoi and marched to the [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]]. He saw how [[Nin’janjin]] struck down Cû’jara-Cinmoi, how the Copper Tree of Siöl fell into pitching masses of [[Sranc]], and the Cûnuroi were dismayed. Sin’niroiha, the High King of Nihrimsul and Ishoriöl, fought his way to Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s position, but found only his headless body. Realizing their plight, Sin’niroiha rallied his people and began fighting his way into the [[Ring Mountains]]. A greater part of the surviving Cûnuroi followed him. Once clear of their foe, the glorious Ishroi of [[Eärwa]] fled, gripped by a mad fear.{{EG|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars}}

Sin’niroiha became the effective leader of the Nonmen in their wars against the Inchoroi, but found his lack of Tsonos blood occasioned disrespect from the other Mansions, despite their mutual peril. Ishoriöl's proximity to the Ark resulted in frequent battles, with Ishoriöl besieged on no less than five occasions with spans exceeding ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Ishterebinth'&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years after the Battle of Pir Minginnial, during the [[Siege of the Second Delve]], Sin’niroiha died of old age and his son Nil'giccas succeeded him, eventually leading the Nonmen to victory at the [[Battle of Isal’imial]] and the cleansing of the Ark. Some believe that Nil'giccas succeeded because his Tsonos blood gave him greater legitimacy and respect in the eyes of the other Mansions. In some traditions, Sin’niroiha was the last Nonman to die of age.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Sin’niroiha'&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ajokli''' is the God of thievery and deception. Though listed among the primary [[Gods]] in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]],'' there is no true Cult of Ajokli, but rather an informal network of devotees scattered across the great cities of the [[Three Seas]].

Ajokli is oft mentioned in the secondary scriptures of the different [[Cults]], sometimes as a mischievous companion of the Gods, other times as a cruel or malicious competitor.

In the ''[[Mar’eddat]],'' he is the faithless husband of Gierra.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Ajokli’&lt;/ref&gt;

Idols of Ajokli show him as a leering figure with a huge penis that reaches up to his chin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">[[File:Gilgaol.jpg|thumb|300px|The god of conflict and war, Gilgaöl is the brother of Yatwer.]]
'''Gilgaöl''' is the [[Gods|God]] of war and conflict. He is one of the so-called [[Compensatory Gods]], who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife.

Gilgaöl is the second most popular of the Hundred Gods, only after his sister [[Yatwer]].

In the ''[[Higarata]],'' the collection of subsidiary writings that form the scriptural core of the [[Cults]], Gilgaöl is depicted as harsh and sceptical of [[Men]], continually demanding proof of worth from those who would follow him. Though subordinate to the [[Thousand Temples]], the Gilgallic Cult boasts nearly as many priests, and perhaps receives more in the way of sacrificial donations&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Gilgaöl’&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gilgaöl is also known as the '''Shield-Breaker'''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Shield-Breaker, the’&lt;/ref&gt; and '''One-Eyed War'''&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;.

At least the position of High Cultist of Gilgaöl is hereditary. The priests took part in the celebration of [[Ikurei Conphas]]’s victory over the [[Scylvendi]]:
:“In accordance with custom, the hereditary priests of Gilgaöl brought basins of water. As Conphas expected, they smeared lion’s blood on his limbs and, muttering prayers, cleansed his symbolic wounds.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

They also sacrifice goshawks, dogs and lions, by burning them in godfires for the sake of those at war&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 7; ''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 6; ''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;. Other goshawks are released into the setting evening sun&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;. At least in one case, the hide of a lion was retained by the offerer&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;.

After battle the priests of Gilgaöl preside over the declaration of [[Battle-Celebrant]]. In their ornamental red hauberks, the Gilgallic Priests rise to declare the Battle-Celebrant. The High Cultist of Gilgaöl steps to the forefront of the others, performs the Gilgallic rites, and moves to stand over the Battle-Celebrant. He is told to kneel, and a circlet woven of thorns and olive sprigs, is placed on his head; the High Cultist of Gilgaöl finally cries, “Rise, [name], … Battle-Celebrant!”&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the task of the High Cultist to consult his omen-texts to determine the will of the God&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;.

In ancient [[Sakarpus|Sakarpi]] legend, Gilgaöl is said to have had a mortal daughter named [[Aelswë]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

I felt like, seeing the images out of context (without the words), they could be pictures of any old alien or monster or whatever.  Sort of wanted to tag them so, the internet being what it is, people would see them and associate them with something, hopefully giving Bakker another possible lead on readers who may not have heard of him.  That was my reasoning, anyway.</text>

'''Akkeägni''' is the [[Gods|God]] of disease. Also known as the God of a Thousand Hands. Scholars have oft noted the irony that the Priesthood of Disease provides the primary repository of physicians for the [[Three Seas]]. How can one at once worship disease and war against it? According to the scriptures of the [[Cults|Cult]], the ''[[Piranavas]],'' Akkeägni is a so-called [[Bellicose Gods|Bellicose God]], one who favours those who strive against him over sycophants and worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Akkeägni’&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Akkeägni’s priests bear tattoos. They also use small prayer chimes which sound thanks to Akkeägni,&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; and use pharmaka and reliquaries to combat illness.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the so-called [[Compensatory Gods]], who reward devotion in life with paradise in the afterlife, Husyelt comes after only [[Yatwer]] and [[Gilgaöl]] in Cultic popularity, particularly in the Middle-North. In the ''[[Higarata]],'' the collection of subsidiary writings that form the scriptural core of the [[Cults]], Husyelt is depicted as the most anthropocentric of the [[Gods|Hundred Gods]], as intent upon enabling his worshippers as he is upon securing their obedience and devotion.{{EG|Husyelt}} In ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]],'' after:

:“The Prophet [[Angeshraël]] came down from his fast on [[Mount Eshki]]. Husyelt, the Tusk tells us, sent a hare to him, so he might eat at last. Angeshraël skinned the Hunter’s gift and struck a fire so he might feast. When he had eaten and was content, sacred Husyelt, the Holy Stalker, joined him at his fire, for the Gods in those days had not left the world in the charge of Men. Angeshraël, recognizing the God as the God, fell immediately to his knees before the fire, not thinking where he would throw his face. And the God said, ‘Why does our Prophet fall to his knees only? Are not Prophets Men like other [[Men]]? Should they not throw their faces to the earth?’ To which Angeshraël replied, ‘I find my fire before me.’ And peerless Husyelt said, ‘The fire burns across earth, and what fire consumes becomes earth. I am your God. Throw your face to the earth.’ So Angeshraël, the Tusk tells us, bowed his head ''into the flames.''”{{2|11}}

The Cult of Husyelt is rumoured to be extraordinarily wealthy, and high-ranking members of the Husyeltic priesthood often possess as much political clout as Shrial apparati.{{EG|Husyelt}} Shanks of butchered antelope are burned for Husyelt.{{2|6}} After cursing, some superstitious people counter by making “the sign of Husyelt, the Dark Hunter.”{{1|P}} Husyelt is also commonly called the Dark Hunter and the Stalker.{{EG|Dark Hunter, the}}{{EG|Stalker, the}}

''of a man, we call him an abomination.''&lt;br /&gt;

—[[Ajencis]], ''[[The Third Analytic of Men]]''

==Synopsis==
''Autumn, 19 [[New Imperial Year]] (4131 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]]), the “[[Dameöri Wilderness|Long Side]]”''

''Sranc''

A human horn sounds followed by a moment of silence. Then [[Sranc]] come, running and howling with fury. They smell mannish blood. They run with joy, but the ground breaks beneath them. They’ve been ambushed. A handful of [[Men]] lunge into the Sranc’s midst and hack them to pieces.

''Traveller''

A lone traveller calls out to a group of [[Scalpoi]]. They stare in his direction, ‘Just like animals,’ he thinks. He continues to approach passing a dead Sranc. The men return to their work save for three who continue to watch him warily. He has no doubt that the one he seeks is among them. The traveller walks into the scalpers’ midst as they cut flaps of skin from the crown of each dead Sranc. They are extremely conscious of his arrival, but they pretend otherwise.

The [[Scalping Years]] began nearly eleven years ago, when the [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] declared the bounty on Sranc scalps. Most scalpers died within weeks, some prospered, and a few became legendary.

The traveller finds the man he seeks watching the others work. Behind him sits a [[Nil’giccas|second man]], his face concealed by a black cowl. He is looking for an [[High Ainon|Ainon]]i called [[Kosoter|Ironsoul]], he declares. The man, who is a veteran of the [[Holy War|First Holy War]], asks how he had found him, to which the traveller replies that they ‘find everyone,’ and that they want him.

''Late Autumn, 19 New Imperial Year (4131 Year-of-the-Tusk), [[Momemn]]''

''Anasûrimbor Kelmomas''

His [[Whelming]] complete, young [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas]] watches a beetle as it hurries across the floor of the Allosium in Momemn. He follows it to the outermost aisle of the [[Allosium Forum]], where the idols of the Hundred [[Gods]] resided. The beetle approaches the idol of [[Ajokli]], the Four-Horned Brother. The Thief. Kelmomas observes that the godhouse of Ajokli is much poorer than the godhouses of his brothers and sisters. He thinks that the idol is also watching the beetle. He smiles and nods at the God. Suddenly, Kelmomas is moved by an unaccountable whim; he pins the beetle to the floor and pinches off two of its legs. He laughs to the Idol and begs it watch as the beetle spins around in panic. They “laugh together.” His [[Esmenet|mother]] approaches from behind him. Kelmomas is not surprised by her; he knew where she was all along. She has been painted white as part of his Whelming ceremony. He’s very excited to see her and thinks that she is the “world’s most beautiful thing.” She embraces him. “Never was there such a sanctuary,” he thinks. He follows her out of the Allosium. Looking back at Ajokli, he finds him still laughing at the beetle.

Kelmomas’ secret voice reminds him that he must hate and fear his father. He must never forget that the Strength burns brightest in his father.

Outside, they stand on the crest of the monumental steps that fanned down to the expanse of the [[Scuäri Campus]] looking upon the vast and mottled vista of the Momemn, the capital of the [[Three Seas]]. The [[Imperial Precincts]] are flooded with pilgrims and Momemnites who have come for the Whelming ceremony. Kelmomas, however, is repulsed and thinks that people are bugs. His mother leads him down the steps. A group of his father’s bodyguards escorts them through the Scuäri Campus toward the [[Andiamine Heights]]. Kelmomas asks Esmenet about her first daughter, [[Mimara]]. He is jealous of his mother’s love for her and recalls that it was the secret voice that made him drive her away, but now he thinks that maybe he should have killed her. Kelmomas asks about his father and smiles at the thought that he might die if the [[Great Ordeal]] fails.

Then there is commotion. Assassins approach.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">[[File:New Empire.png|thumb|center|650px|The Kellian Empire in 4132 Year-of-the-Tusk]]
The '''New Empire''' (the '''Kellian Empire''') is the Empire founded by [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] following the [[Holy War|First Holy War]] and the [[Unification Wars]].

It spans the entirety of the [[Three Seas]], from the legendary fortress of [[Auvangshei]] on the frontiers of [[Zeüm]] to the shrouded headwaters of the [[River Sayut]], from the sweltering coasts of [[Kutnarmu]] to the wild rim of the [[Osthwai Mountains]]—all the lands that had once been [[Fanimry|Fanim]] or [[Inrithism|Inrithi]].

It was easily the equal of the old [[Ceneian Empire]] in terms of geographical extent, and likely far greater when it came to population.

A hundred great cities, and almost as many languages. A dozen proud nations. Thousand of years of mangled history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' What Has Come Before …&lt;/ref&gt;

Anasûrimbor Kellhus was proclaimed [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] after the defeat of [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri]] at [[Shimeh]] in 4112. Both the [[Kian]]ene and the [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] empires collapsed shortly thereafter, leaving him the undisputed master of the Western Three Seas. Thirteen years of internecine and expansionist war followed. Many factors were instrumental to his success, including his martial brilliance and the fanaticism of his [[Zaudunyani]] Inrithi. But it would be his control of the [[Thousand Temples]] (which allowed him to so quickly consolidate his gains) and his alliance with the [[The Schools|School]] of [[Mandate]] (which gave him the sorcerous advantage on every field of battle) that would prove decisive. The so-called Unifications Wars ended with the final capitulation of [[Nilnamesh]] in 4126, rendering Anasûrimbor Kellhus the greatest conqueror since [[Far Antiquity]]. Not even the legendary [[Triamis the Great]] (2456-2577) achieved so much in so short a time.

'''Idrusus Geraus''' is [[Drusas Achamian]]’s [[Galeoth]] slave. Geraus visits the [[Scalpoi]] entrepôt of [[Marrow]] three or four times a year, to sell his pelts and, with the gold Achamian gave him, secure goods for his family and Achamian. An even-tempered, slow-speaking man, he always came back with stories of his visits.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The wars unfolded as follows:

* '''4112-4126'''—[[Unification Wars]]. The [[Kellian Empire]] accumulates from the detritus of the nations that preceded it.
** '''4113'''-The Year of the Child Grandees; Nenciphon falls, Kianene Empire dissolved.
** '''4114'''-The ''[[Novum Arcanum]]'' is circulated throughout the Three Seas; [[Rash Soptet]] (4088— ) is hailed as “Lord of the Sempis” after quelling Fanim uprisings. Schismatics denounce Maithanet; the [[War-between-Temples]] begins. Kellhus issues the [[Rehabilitation of Sorcery]], rescinding all Shrial and Tusk condemnations of sorcery. Kellhus also issues the [[Manumission of the Feminine]], awarding equal social, legal and moral status to the the women of the Three Seas. Combined, the two also allow the legitimising of female sorcerers. The [[Swayal Compact]] is founded shortly after this time, with Kellhus ordering them to be trained in the Gnosis by the Mandate.
** '''4115'''-Prince [[Shoddû Akirapita]] (4099—4123) routes the first Zaudunyani invasion of Nilnamesh at the [[Battle of Pinropis]].
** '''4116'''-The death of King Eryeat, combined with the secret conversion of his eldest surviving son, Coithus Narnol, delivers Galeoth to the Empire nearly intact. King Hringa Vûkyelt expels Schismatics from Thunyerus.
** '''4117'''-The first songs extolling the exploits of [[Sasal Charapatha]] against the Nilnameshi Orthodox begin circulating throughout the Three Seas; First Carythusali uprising; Earl Couras Nantilla is Whelmed, raises Cengemic provincesin revolt against Meigeiri; the Tydonni Orthodox begin massacring Ketyai villages and towns along the Eleterine Coast.
** '''4118'''-Meigeiri falls; Anasûrimbor Kellhus orders the Orthodox of Numaineiri blinded; [[Eselos Mursidides]] (4081—4132) conquers Cironj for the Zaudunyani losing, miraculously, only one hundred and eighteen souls.
** '''4119'''-The [[Koraphean Uprising]]; [[Hoga Hogrim]] (4093— ) is declared Zaudunyani Believer-King of Ce Tydonn; King Hringa Vûkyelt of Thunyerus declares himself a Believer-King as well; the Mandate takes up residence in Kiz.
** '''4120'''-Anasûrimbor Kellhus declares Imperial Bounty on Sranc scalps; [[Sack of Sarneveh]]; Circulation of the [[Toll]] pamphlet, and subsequent Toll uprisings.
** '''4121'''-[[Nurbanu Soter]] (4069— ) declared King-Regent of High Ainon; Invishi falls after the famed [[Throwing-of-the-Hulls]].
** '''4122'''- Nilnameshi Orthodox crushed at the [[Battle of Ushgarwal]]. Anasûrimbor Kellhus declares the Unification Wars concluded. The Shriah of the Thousand Temples, Maithanet, proclaims him Holy Aspect-Emperor of the Three Seas.
* '''4123'''-Prince Shoddû Akirapita (4099—4123) is found drowned in a well in Girgash. Only Fanayal ab Kascamandri remains of the Empire’s notorious enemies.
* '''4124'''- Reconstruction of Auvangshei begins.
* '''4125'''- First of the [[Angnaya]] are sent to the Palace of Plumes in Zeum.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Unification Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraph==
''We burn like over-fat candles, our centres gouged,''&lt;br /&gt;
''our edges curling in, our wick forever outrunning our wax.''&lt;br /&gt;
''We resemble what we are: Men who never sleep.''&lt;br /&gt;
—Anonymous Mandate Schoolman, ''[[The Heiromantic Primer]]''

==Synopsis==
''[[Hûnoreal]]''

''Early Spring, 19 [[New Imperial Year]] (4132 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]]), Southwestern [[Galeoth]]''

''Drusas Achamian''

Although [[Drusas Achamian]] has renounced his [[The Schools|School]], he still suffers the same nightmares of the [[Apocalypse|First Apocalypse]] that plague all [[Mandate]] Schoolmen. At a great feast, [[Seswatha]] watches as [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], High-King and his best friend, drinks himself into unconsciousness. He then leaves and finds his way to the High-King’s chambers where [[Suriala]], the High-King’s wife, awaits him. The two make love.

Achamian wakes up gasping.

He has been a [[Wizard]] for nearly twenty years, and he has slept and studied the [[Seswatha’s Dreams]] in his room for nearly as long. He walks to his worktable and braces himself for the recital to come.

''Drusas Achamian''

He tries to write down a detailed account of the Dream, but all he ends up with is “[[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti|NAU-CAYÛTI]]?” Celmomas’ famed son, whose heroic exploits against the [[No-God]] and his [[Consult]] are recited on hundreds of tomes in the libraries of the Mandate. Achamian has noticed that the frequency of the Dreams involving Nau-Cayûti was far out of proportion to his short-lived role in the Apocalypse. He wonders if Nau-Cayûti was in truth Seswatha’s son. He tries to date the Dream but he’s interrupted by his slaves again. Outside, a woman approaches his tower on a mule. She speaks Sheyic, the common tongue of the [[New Empire]]. It’s been five or six years since he’s had visitors. “Visitors meant grief,” Achamian thinks.

''Drusas Achamian''

The woman is [[Esmenet]]’s first daughter, [[Mimara]]. Achamian wonders if she was the reason why Esmenet had chosen [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] over him. Mimara says that she came to him because she wanted to know if he’s her father. He tells her that he met her mother after she had sold her into slavery, and that the daughters of whores have no fathers. She’s about thirty years of age, he thinks. Her mother must have recovered her years ago, for her manner is too studied and graceful. Achamian bids her go home, back to her mother. They have no connection, he says. She informs him that she is one of the [[The Few|Few]], and that she did not really come to find her father, but her teacher. She wants to learn the [[Gnosis]].

''Mimara''

Mimara thinks that Achamian possesses the “soul of a teacher,” just as her mother—the old whore—had told her. She left the [[Andiamine Heights]] about three months ago, travelling alone. The place was just as she expected it, except for one thing, the Wizard. She is surprised to see that Achamian is a “wild-haired hermit with limbs like barked branches and eyes that perpetually sort grievances. Bitter. Severe.” She sees the [[Mark]] on him. How could anyone sing songs about such a man? She wonders.

She tells him about the [[Swayal Compact]], the only School for [[Witch]]es in the [[Three Seas]], and how her mother would not allow her to join it. Achamian tells her to go home again. He would sooner be her father than her teacher.

''Mimara''

At night, Mimara builds a bonfire and waits outside the old Wizard’s window. “Teach me!” She screams. At first there is no answer, but then the Wizard comes out to confront her. They stare at each other for a moment before he hits her with his staff and enters the tower again. She falls down and begins to laugh, and once again she screams ''“Teeeach meeeee!”''

'''Porsparian nesh Varalti''' was a slave provided to [[Varalt Sorweel]] by [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas]] to attend to his needs.



Porsparian is a wizened old man who is anything but the submissive thrall he pretends to be. One night Sorweel watches him tear away the turf and mould the face of the Goddess [[Yatwer]] from the dirt. Before his eyes, mud bubbles up as spit from her earthen lips. The slave palms this mud and smears it across the incredulous King’s cheeks.&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hanamem Sharacinth''' was the officially sanctioned Matriarch of the [[The Cult of Yatwer|Cult of Yatwer]].{{4|5}}

==Appearance==
Sharacinth has narrow eyes, and a slightly bent face.

==Story==
===''The Judging Eye''===
At [[Maithanet]]’s bidding, [[Esmenet]] summons Sharacinth to the [[Andiamine Heights]] with the intention of setting the Cult of Yatwer against itself. When they fail to cow the woman, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] himself arrives and breaks her will with sheer force of presence. The blubbering Matriarch yields, promising to wrest her Cult from [[Psatma Nannaferi]].{{4|9}}

That night, [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas]] murders Sharacinth in her bedroom.{{4|12}}

'''Maëngi''' is a [[Consult]] [[Skin-spies|skin-spy]] who kills and impersonates the Knight-Commander of the [[Shrial Knights]], [[Cutias Sarcellus]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Sarcellus, Cutias’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
===''What Came Before''===
Maëngi kills and replaces Sarcellus.

===''The Darkness That Comes Before''===
While [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian ]]and [[Paro Inrau|Inrau ]]are having a heated conversation at a tavern in [[Sumna]], Maëngi (as Sarcellus) arrives with two other Shrial knights and recognizes Inrau. Maëngi intercedes and asks Inrau if Achamian is bothering him. Achamian affects the persona of Inrau's rude and drunken uncle, which causes Maëngi to strike him to the ground and express a desire to kill him. Achamian notices that the eyes of "Sarcellus" are curiously empty.

Maëngi and the [[Synthese]] ambush [[Paro Inrau]] in [[Sumna]] before Inrau commits suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the guise of Sarcellus, Maëngi breaks up the stoning of [[Esmenet]] at a town outside Sumna. A local priest objects to his interference, but Maëngi strikes him with his mailed fist, asserting his authority through force. He takes Esmenet with him to [[Momemn]] where the [[Holy War]] gathers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before,'' Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Warrior-Prophet''===
Maëngi is killed at the [[Fifth Battle of Mengedda]], and another skin-spy, [[Gaörta]], takes over the role of Cutias Sarcellus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet,'' Chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Dûnyain philosophy}}
The Dûnyain believe the will to be illusory, an artifact of the soul’s inability to perceive what comes before it. They believe—contrary to the dominant stream of [[Three Seas]] thought—that the soul is ''part of the world'', as much driven by prior events as anything else. In other words, [[Men]] do not possess ‘self-moving souls’. Far from a given, such a soul is an ''accomplishment'' for the Dûnyain. All souls, they claim, possess ''conatus'', the natural striving to be self-moving, to escape the circle of before and after. They naturally seek to ''know'' the world about them and so climb out of the circle. But a host of factors make outright escape impossible. The soul Men are born with is too obtuse and clouded by animal passions to be anything other than a slave of what comes before. The whole point of the Dûnyain ethos is to overcome these limitations and so become a self-moving soul—to attain the Absolute, or the Unconditioned Soul.{{EG|Dûnyain}}

==Conditioning==
To achieve this goal, the Dûnyain instituted a program of selective breeding for intellect and dispassion. They undergo arduous physical, emotional, and intellectual training, what they call the ''[[conditioning]]''. The Dûnyain believe that, using [[Logos|reason]], they can condition themselves to the point of becoming ''unconditioned''.{{EG|Conditioning, the}}

Few others in the [[Three Seas]] credit their claims, however.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Celmomian Prophecy’&lt;/ref&gt;

I was tossing a few of my drawings on some characters that didn't have an image, and happened to see a few little spelling things that I figured I'd fix up! This wiki is AMAZING, I somehow didn't even know about it until recently (I know there was another one, but it's not nearly as good as this, at least it doesn't feel like it). Mad props to you for making/maintaining this! </text>

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2747">The '''Second Apocalypse''' is the successor conflict to the [[Apocalypse|First Apocalypse]], during which time the [[No-God]] was summoned by the [[Consult]] to bring about the annihilation of humankind and the sealing of [[the World]] against the [[Outside]], thus saving a minority from damnation at the expense of the majority. The No-God was defeated at the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]] in 2155 by King [[Anaxophus V]] of [[Kyraneas]], who used the [[Heron Spear]], an [[Inchoroi]] [[Spears of light|spear of light]], to penetrate the Sarcophagus and apparently kill the No-God. In some traditions, the Sarcophagus was completely incinerated and the ashes scattered across [[Eärwa]], triggering the [[Indigo Plague]]. [[Mandate]] warnings to the contrary were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Second Apocalypse’&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, however, the Sarcophagus was only damaged, not destroyed. It was recovered by the Consult and returned to [[Golgotterath]], where it was repaired to the best of their knowledge. The Consult then spent the next two thousand years attempt to reactivate the Sarcophagus. In 4132, at the conclusion of the [[Great Ordeal]]'s disastrous campaign against Golgotterath, they succeeded. The Second Apocalypse has begun and the No-God walks the earth once more.&lt;ref&gt;[[''The Unholy Consult'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mandate tradition, [[Anasûrimbor Celmomas II]], the High King of [[Kûniüri]] during the [[Apocalypse]], [[Celmomian Prophecy|prophesied]] that the No-God will in fact return but an Anasûrimbor would return to stop him. The prevention of the Second Apocalypse was the Mandate’s ultimate goal, in which they failed. It was [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]'s campaign which in fact led to the Second Apocalypse, as the Consult wanted to trap Kellhus himself within the Sarcophagus. This failed and Kellhus was slain. His son [[Anasûrimbor Kelmomas]] was instead placed within the Sarcophagus, triggering the resurrection of the No-God, which promptly destroyed the Great Ordeal. The resurrection of the No-God triggered the beginning of the [[Years of the Crib|Second Years of the Crib]], preventing the birth of any further children.

The outcome of the Second Apocalypse remains to be seen, but the destruction of the Great Ordeal has denuded the [[Three Seas]] of almost all men of fighting age and health. Only the military and sorcerous potential of the nation of [[Zeüm]] remains unspent. The No-God has access to far vaster numbers of [[sranc]] than existed during the First Apocalypse and the support of [[Dûnyain]] sorcerer-advisors, as well as the allegiance of the [[Scylvendi]]. The odds would appear hopeless.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="886">The '''Conditioning''' is specifically, the arduous physical, emotional, and intellectual training undergone by [[Dûnyain]] monks, though the term has more general and far-reaching connotations as well.

The Dûnyain believe that everything is conditioned in some way, but they draw a principled distinction between the arbitrary conditioning of the world and the rational conditioning of [[Men]]. Conditioning in the light of the [[Logos]], they believe, allows ''more'' such conditioning, which in turn leverages more such conditioning, and so on.

This virtuous circle, they believe, finds its apotheosis in the [[Absolute]]: the Dûnyain believe that, using reason, they can condition themselves to the point of becoming ''unconditioned,'' a perfect, self-moving soul.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Conditioning, the’&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ikurei Xerius III]] (reigned ?-4112)&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thousandfold Thought''' is the thread of act and consequence that would prevent the [[Consult]] from resurrecting the [[No-God]] and bringing about the [[Second Apocalypse]]. It was crafted by [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus]] in the years he spent among the [[Cishaurim]] of [[Kian]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Judging Eye (Book)|The Judging Eye]]'', What Has Comes Before...&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps we should edit this template to include an image and a caption at the top? For example [http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark a] , or [http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Rand_al'Thor b] . No need to change much, just add two rows for image and caption. Or since there are only a few characters with fan art available, another option is to make a new template for those pages.

Also, ''"It is pure enlightenment beyond imagination"'', I don’t see any support in the text for this.

Maybe this entry should be removed for now or revised significantly. [[User:Qma|Qma]] ([[User talk:Qma|talk]]) 14:57, November 17, 2014 (UTC)</text>

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="376">Hi Serwe,

Yes, I remember.  Sorry, I just haven't had the time/inspiration for much yet.  I'm looking into creating a custom PON font based on the Kuniuric script on the books, but tbh that's a slow burner for now.  Maybe I can run it by you before I make any changes to the wiki.  I have a few irons in the fire, though, so not sure how soon this will be.

Thanks again,</text>

The '''Great Ordeal''' was a military campaign launched by the [[Aspect-Emperor (Title)|Aspect-Emperor]] of the [[Three Seas]], [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], against [[Golgotterath]]. Its aim was to prevent the [[Consult]] from resurrecting the [[No-God]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye,'' Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;The total number of men when the host set off numbered at more than 300,000. A quarter of these are said to have been lost at [[Irsûlor]], another quarter or more at [[Dagliash]], and only one third remaining after the catastrophe at Dagliash, due to the rest having succumbed to disease or starvation.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Ordeal&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it reached Golgotterath, it numbered at only around 30,000. &lt;ref&gt;The Unholy Consult, Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ciögli the Mountain''' was the strongest of the [[Nonmen|Nonman]] [[Ishroi]]. He broke the neck of [[Wutteät|Wutteät the Black]], the Father of Dragons on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]] during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt; He was himself wrestled and was defeated by [[Aurang]], though he apparently survived.

He was ultimately killed in battle by an arrow to the eye.

==Summary==
'''Mid-Spring, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], [[Sumna]]'''

Sumna and the rest of the [[Three Seas]] are in the grips of the [[Holy War]], and the propaganda by the Shrial apparati. Everywhere men, nobles and [[caste]]-menials, are preparing to go to war. ''“[[Maithanet]] had called, and the entire Three Seas had answered. The back of the heathen would be broken. Holy [[Shimeh]] would be cleansed.”''

Meanwhile, [[Esmenet]] has some bitter memories regarding her [[Mimara|daughter]]. She thinks about her love for [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] (and Achamian’s love for her), and the impossibility of stopping to take custom while he’s with her; she needs to keep her customers interested, because Akka eventually always leaves. They are falling into their old habits, when there’s a knock on the door. It’s [[Paro Inrau|Inrau]], who has a bit of news for Akka: Maithanet has asked the [[Scarlet Spires]] to join the Holy War. Akka is quick to explain that the presence of a [[The Schools|School]] is needed to get the army to Shimeh. A sorcerous counter for the [[Cishaurim]] is a necessity. Furthermore, it is to be expected that the Emperor will try to subvert the Holy War to his own needs; by employing the Scarlet Spires they can bypass a dependency on the [[Imperial Saik]], the School indentured to the Emperor of [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]]. Esmenet points out that Maithanet must know something that would make the Scarlet Spires susceptible to the offer. Akka realizes that Maithanet ''knows'' about [[Sasheoka]]’s murder by the Cishaurim, which greatly disturbs him. He manages to get Inrau to get closer to Maithanet himself and to spy on him, because he shows himself to be altogether too canny to be what he seems.

Inrau thinks to himself about the two different paths of his life: ''“Through the wash, he could hear the supplicants wail. Arched into shapes of pain and sorrow, their song ran across the wet stone and cupped his thoughts in stretched notes. Hymns of suffering. Two voices: one pitched high and plaintive, asking why must we suffer, always why; the other low, filled with the brooding grandeur of the [[Thousand Temples]] and bearing the gravity of truth — that men were at one with suffering and ruin, that tears were the only holy waters.”'' Inrau feels indebted to Achamian, because he knows that by allowing him to escape the [[Mandate]], Achamian saved his life.

Inrau goes to pray at an altar devoted to [[Onkis]], ''“the Singer-in-the-Dark, the Aspect who stood at the heart of all men, moving them to forever grasp more than they could hold.”'' Inrau asks whether Onkis will forgive him for returning to the Mandate, and asks for strength when he hears voices behind him, and the flapping of wings. Looking for the source, he eventually steps out on the balcony.

Inrau realizes he is being confronted by the [[Consult]]; Lord [[Cutias Sarcellus|Sarcellus]] and [[Mujonish]], another Shrial Knight Inrau knows are also there. Sarcellus reveals that Inrau was spying for Achamian. Inrau is horrified that Consult is not only real, but much more up to speed than Akka knows, or even fears.

Inrau plays for time, in hopes of unleashing some [[sorcery]]. When he does, Mujonish grabs him by the hair, but ''“blasphemy tumbled from his lips.”'' Inrau turns to Mujonish and punches two fingers through his chain-mail and breastbone to seize Mujonish’s heart. Inrau utters more ''“impossible words”'', and the blood that is strewn about bursts into incandescent flame. Inrau striks out towards the [[Synthese]], which ducks with a shriek. ''“Blinding beads of blood cracked bare stone.”'' As he turns towards Sarcellus, Mujonish’s corpse distracts him: ''“The Shrial Knight had stumbled to his knees, wiping his bloody hands on his surcoat. Then, as though spilling from a bladder, his face simply fell apart, dropping outward, unclutching … No mark. Not the faintest whisper of sorcery. But how?”'' Sarcellus pummels the distracted Inrau, and uses a [[Chorae]] to subdue him. The Synthese orders Inrau to relent, but Inrau refuses. He uses further sorcery, but the Synthese is far too powerful. ''Oh, Akka! It’s worse than you dared imagine.''

Inrau manages to lunge towards the balcony, not to kill the Synthese perched on the railing, but himself.

==Summary==
'''Early Summer, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], [[Momemn]]'''

Emperor [[Ikurei Xerius III]], is preparing for a major audience in the Imperial Audience Hall. He’s discussing the course to take with [[Skeaös]], an old slave and Xerius’ Prime Counsel. Xerius hints that his nephew, [[Ikurei Conphas|Conphas]], is on a dangerous and important mission. Skeaös tries to sooth the Emperor’s nerves. Xerius notices something strange about Skeaös, even though he’s not sure what it is.

The entourage he is about to receive are the lords from [[Conriya]], headed by [[Nersei Calmemunis]]. The Men of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]] who had, until then, been showing up outside the walls of Momemn were rabble, but not Calmemunis. The great names will be the ''“keel and the rudder”'' of the [[Holy War]], and Xerius intends to be the pilot. Calmemunis, who can’t see Xerius up in the shadows of the dais, immediately sets Xerius nerves on edge by asking about Conphas’ war; it turns out Conphas is on a military campaign against the [[Scylvendi]], but Xerius downplays it as a punitive expedition. Calmemunis isn’t convinced. Xerius goes on to nettle Calmemunis about [[Nersei Proyas|Proyas]], who apparently had him whipped for impiety before a battle, and then manages to offend Calmemunis and his officers further by asking them to sign the Indenture, a charter stipulating that all the conquests the Holy War makes in [[Kian]] will be returned to the [[Nansur Empire]]. The Conriyan lords refuse, and accuse the emperor of playing games ''“with what is holy”''. Xerius compounds the Conriyans anger by threatening to starve them if they don’t sign the Indenture, and things start to get out of hand when Xerius is suddenly shat upon by a sparrow, and completely loses his temper. He orders his guards to shoot all the sparrows down from the upper galleries. As the arrows skitter down, all is in chaos. Afterwards, Xerius descends the dais and picks up a skewered sparrow, thinking ''“A mere bird would never dare offend an emperor.”'' He calmly hands the sparrow to Calmemunis, saying ''“take this as a token of my esteem.”''

Xerius’ augur manages to convince him that being shat upon is a good omen; as a balance to great prosperity/good fortune ''“some token blight must always accompany triumph.”'' Xerius comes upon his mother, [[Ikurei Istriya]], ''“who moved with the willowy grace of a fifteen-year-old virgin, despite her sixty whorish years.”'' Xerius immediately notices something odd in her manner as well. Istriya immediately upbraids him for treating the Conriyans so, as she fears they will sign the Indenture with Xerius’ blood. But Xerius is unmoved. He will feed the Conriyans enough to keep them alive, but not enough to march. Through their wrangling, Istriya realizes that the Indenture is a pretext, something to protect Xerius from Shrial censure when he wants to retake the conquests made by the Men of the Tusk. That’s why Conphas is on a campaign against the Scylvendi: their border must be subdued in order to free the necessary manpower. Istriya loses it, when Xerius derides her fears, and finally has to be dragged away by her eunuch. And Xerius is informed that the [[Fanimry|Fanim]] have sent an emissary … A [[Cishaurim]].

Xerius meets the Cishaurim with three sorcerers from the [[Imperial Saik]], headed by [[Cememketri]], and a dozen [[Chorae]]-bowmen in the galleries. Cememketri informs Xerius that three sorcerers are enough to protect the emperor. The Cishaurim take out their own eyes, and they wear [[Shigek]]i salt asps around their necks. These serve as their eyes. Interestingly enough, Cememketri can’t see the [[Mark]] of [[Sorcery]] on the Cishaurim. The Cishaurim identifies himself as [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus|Mallahet]], adopted son of [[Kisma]], of the tribe [[Indara-Kishauri]]. This horrifies Cememketri, who urges Xerius to flee as they are all in great danger. Apparently, ''“Mallahet is second only to Seokti in the Cishaurim. And only then because their Prophetic Law bars non-Kianene from the position of Heresiarch. Even the Cishaurim are fearful of his power!”'' Oddly enough, Mallahet’s arms are scarred like a Scylvendi. Xerius refuses to budge, however. Mallahet conjures an ephemeral face over his own; the face is that of [[Skauras ab Nalajan|Skauras]], the Sapatishah-Governor of Shigek, for over four decades the enemy of the Empires Southern Columns. In this way, Xerius can talk to Skauras directly. Xerius proposes that fanatics are hard to deal with, so he seeks common ground with Skauras, especially when he learns that [[Maithanet]] doesn’t need the Imperial Saik as he’s already got the [[Scarlet Spires]]. Xerius intends to teach the Men of the Tusk to respect the Fanim, so he can gain control of it again.

==Synopsis==
''[[Sakarpus]]''

''Early Spring, 19 [[New Imperial Year]] (4132 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]]), The [[Kathol Pass]]es''

''Omniscient''

Men never tire of their own delusions. The Aspect-Emperor, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]], has commanded the destruction of all those who dispute the Truth or choose avarice over the demands of the war to come. The war that would prevent the resurrection of the [[No-God]]. The [[Great Ordeal]].

The Aspect-Emperor has devoted the last ten years to prepare for the greatest host in human history. The Great Ordeal is to march all the way from the frontiers of the [[New Empire]] to the stronghold of the [[Consult]], [[Golgotterath]]. But the host has to survive the distance to Golgotterath before it can be tested on the field.

The Great Ordeal marches through the Kathol Pass. King [[Coithus Saubon]] of [[Caraskand]], marches in front with the quicker elements of the host: the [[Kian]]ene, the [[Girgash]]i, the [[Khirgwi]], and the [[Shrial Knights]]. Prince [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas]] rides with his father, leading the [[Kidruhil]]. King [[Nersei Proyas]] of [[Conriya]] follows with the rest of the Host. They approach Sakarpus arriving at the [[Istyuli Plains]].

The two Exalt Generals of the Great Ordeal, Proyas and Saubon, plan the assault on Sakarpus. They recall the days of the First [[Holy War]] and the [[Unification Wars]].

''Varalt Sorweel''

An emissary of the Aspect-Emperor demands to see [[Varalt Harweel II]], the King of Sakarpus. Prince [[Varalt Sorweel]] attends the meeting as Nersei Proyas, the emissary, demands that his father yield the city and its [[Chorae]] Hoard to the Great Ordeal. Sorweel recalls his father telling him that the Aspect-Emperor is a [[Ciphrang]], a Hunger from the [[Outside]]. And that he must be resisted with ‘Sword and Shield,’ and if that fails with ‘spits and curses.’

Nersei Proyas implores Harweel to yield the city peacefully, but the King refuses. Proyas declares that the people of Sakarpus shall soon know the difference between the surrender that leads to slavery, and the surrender that sets one free. He then leaves.

''Varalt Sorweel''

Sorweel wonders why his father had been so openly terrified of the Aspect-Emperor during the meeting with the emissary. Perhaps there’s something his father is not telling him. Not long afterwards, he’s brought to the barracks by the [[High Boonsmen]]. Harweel says that he must see the coming battle so that when his time comes he ‘will not despair.’ Sorweel condemns himself in silence for doubting his father at the moment when he most needed him. He utters the word ‘please,’ but before he could say anything else the door opens and three Horsdelords call out. His last thoughts are ‘forgive me.’

''Varalt Sorweel''

Sorweel finds himself staring down upon the boggling might of the Great Ordeal. Standing with his father on the high curtain walls, he realizes that he and his people are doomed. Then, miraculously, a stork, a bird that is holy to the Sakarpi, appears on the battlements above his father. The two commune in the charged silence that follows, then King Harweel turns and commands that Sorweel be taken to safety. “See that no harm comes to him!” he cries. “He will be our final sword-stroke! Our vengeance!”

Dragged away screaming, the young man watches sorcerous flames engulf the parapets and his father upon them.

''Varalt Sorweel''

A desperate flight ensues, and it seems that the Aspect-Emperor himself pursues them through the chaotic streets. One of his father’s High Boonsmen tells Sorweel that his father is dead. Sorweel is now King. The pursuit ends in the apparent safety of the citadel. Blasting through walls, Anasûrimbor Kellhus effortlessly kills his protectors. He approaches the adolescent Prince, but rather than seizing or striking him, he embraces him. Tells him that he is forgiven, not by him, but by his father’s love for him.

Sorweel weeps for his father and his city; for a world that could ‘wring redemption out of betrayal.’

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4753">Until the [[Gates of Eärwa|Breaking of the Gates]] and the migration of the Four Nations from [[Eänna]], the [[Men]] of [[Eärwa]], called the [[Emwama]] in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', were enslaved by the [[Nonmen]] and spoke debased versions of their masters’ tongues. No trace of these languages remain. Nor does any trace of their original, pre-bondage language remain. The great Nonman history, the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'', or the “Great Pit of Years,” suggests the Emwama originally spoke the same tongue as their kin across the [[Great Kayarsus]].

This has led many to believe that [[Thoti-Eännorean]] is indeed the primeval language of all men. From it are derived all other Mannish languages.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="697">Without doubt, the [[Nonmen]], or Cûnuroi, tongues are among the oldest in [[Eärwa]]. Some Aujic inscriptions predate the first extant example of Thoti-Eännorean, ''The Chronicle of the Tusk'', by more than five thousand years. Auja-Gilcûnni, which has yet to be deciphered, is far older still.

#'''Auja-Gilcûnni''': The lost “ground tongue” of the Nonmen.
#*'''Aujic''': Lost tongue of the Aujan Mansions.
#*'''Ihrimsû''': Tongue of [[Injor-Niyas]].

In the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'', the Sranc are first referred to as the Anyasiri, or the “Tongueless Howlers.” Through the first books of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], the Nonmen chroniclers seem reluctant to attribute the power of speech to the Sranc. By the time the first Nonmen scholars studied and recorded their speech, it had fractured into innumerable dialects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', ‘The Major Languages and Dialects of Eärwa’&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding: 8px 8px 0 8px;"&gt;
'''[[Sorcery]]''' in the world of [[Eärwa]] is the use of language to forcibly influence reality. Or put another way, it is the practice of making the world conform to language, as opposed to philosophy, the practice of making language conform to the world.

Despite a tremendous amount of unresolvable controversy surrounding sorcery, there are several salient features that seem universal to its practice:
*Practitioners must be able to apprehend the [[onta]], the very fabric of what is, which is to say, they must possess the innate ability to see “Creation ''as created.''”
*Sorcery requires precise meanings. This is why incantations are always spoken in a non-native tongue: to prevent the semantic transformation of crucial terms due to the vagaries of daily usage.
*All sorcerous incantations require the sorcerer to say and think two separate things simultaneously. The spoken segment of an incantation (what is often called the “utteral string”) must have its meaning “fixed” or focused with a silent segment (what is often called the “inutteral string”) that is simultaneously thought. The thought incantation sharpens the meaning of the spoken incantation the way the words of one person may be used to clarify the words of another.

There are many metaphysical interpretations of this structure, but the result in each case is the same: the world, which is otherwise utterly indifferent to the words of Men, ''listens'', and sorcerous transformations of reality result.

[[File:BreakingtheGates.jpg|thumb|right|350px]]'''[[Timeline]]''': covering over five thousand years of [[Eärwa]]’s history.
* '''0'''—The legendary [[Gates of Eärwa|Breaking of the Gates]], the name given to the assault on the Gates of Eärwa, a series of fortified passes through the [[Great Kayarsus]], by the Men of [[Eänna]]. [[Angeshraël]], the most famed Old Prophet of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|Tusk]], leads the [[Five Tribes of Men]]: the [[Norsirai]], the [[Ketyai]], the [[Satyothi]], the [[Scylvendi]], and the [[Xiuhianni]] into Eärwa, though according to ''The Chronicle of the Tusk,'' the Xiuhianni refused to follow the other four tribes. This marks the beginning of the Second Age.
* '''?'''—The Prophet Angeshraël incites the Four Nations of Men to embark on a holy war of extermination against the [[Nonmen]]. Men and Nonmen fight the Cûno-Halaroi Wars, of which very few accounts exist. Within the course of a few generations, the Nonmen were nearly exterminated. Only the Mansions of [[Ishterebinth|Ishoriöl]] and [[Cil-Aujas]] survived.
* '''?'''—The [[Jiünati Steppe]] is inhabited by Scylvendi pastoralists.
* '''?'''—Over a relatively brief period of time, the High Norsirai tribes that settled the rich alluvial plains along the lower [[River Aumris]] founded the first cities of Men, including [[Trysë]], [[Sauglish]], Etrith, and [[Ûmerau]]. As a result of trade with the Nonmen of [[Injor-Niyas]], the power and sophistication of the Aumris River civilization grows quickly.
* '''''c.'' 300 / 4th c.'''—High Norsirai city-states along the River Aumris unite under Cûnwerishau, the God-King of Trysë. Sometime in the fourth century, Cûnwerishau and [[Nil’giccas]], the Nonman King of Ishoriöl, make a treaty between their two peoples, the first between Nonmen and Men. As part of the treaty, Cûnwerishau is given a copy of the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'', the great work chronicling the history of the Nonmen prior to the Breaking of the Gates.
* '''''c.'' 430'''—God-Kings of Trysë are overthrown. The [[Ûmeri Empire]], the first great nation of Men, encompassing the length of the River Aumris, is founded.

&lt;div style="padding: 8px 8px 0 8px;"&gt;
{{Gods gallery}}The '''[[Gods|Hundred Gods]]''' is the collective name of the Gods enumerated in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'' and worshiped either under the auspices of the [[Cults]] (which is to say, subordinate to the [[Thousand Temples]]), or in the traditional versions of the [[Kiünnat]].

In the [[Inrithism|Inrithi]] tradition, the Hundred Gods are thought to be aspects of the God (whom [[Inri Sejenus]] famously called “the Million Souled”), much the same way various personality traits could be said to inhabit a single individual. In the far more variegated Kiünnat tradition, the Hundred Gods are thought to be independent spiritual agencies, prone to indirectly intervene in the lives of their worshippers.

Both the Kiünnat and the Inrithi traditions recognize the differences between the '''Compensatory Gods''', who promise direct reward for worship and devotion, the '''Punitive Gods''', who secure sacrifices through the threat of suffering, and the more rare '''Bellicose Gods''', who despise worship as sycophancy and favor those who strive against them. Both the Inrithi and Kiünnat traditions also see the Gods as indispensable to eternal life in the Outside.

The esoteric apologist [[Zarathinius]] is infamous for arguing (in ''[[A Defence of the Arcane Arts]]'') the absurdity of worshipping deities as imperfect and capricious as mere Men.

The Fanim, believe the Hundred Gods are renegade slaves of the [[Solitary God]] — demons.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">==Description==
This template is used to insert descriptions on template pages.

==Syntax==
Add &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{t|documentation}}&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the template page.

==Usage==

===On the Template page===
This is the normal format when used:

&lt;pre&gt;
TEMPLATE CODE&lt;includeonly&gt;Any categories to be inserted into articles by the template&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{documentation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

''If your template is not a completed div or table, you may need to close the tags just before &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{documentation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is inserted (within the noinclude tags).''

''A line break right before &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{documentation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can also be useful as it helps prevent the documentation template "running into" previous code.''

===On the Template/doc page===
Normally, you will want to write something like the following on the documentation page:

&lt;pre&gt;
==Description==
This template is used to do something.

==Syntax==
Type &lt;code&gt;{{t|templatename}}&lt;/code&gt; somewhere.

==Samples==
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;{{templatename|input}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

results in...

{{templatename|input}}

&lt;includeonly&gt;Any categories for the template itself&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use any or all of the above description/syntax/sample output sections. You may also want to add "see also" or other sections.

Note that the above example also uses the [[Template:T]] and [[Template:T/piece]] templates.

&lt;includeonly&gt;[[Category:Templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

== Description ==
The Second Apocalypse is an epic series of dark, thoughtful novels written by author R. Scott Bakker.

"Our history is one of butchery, hatred and obscenity. So dark, so grim it often exceeds our ability to believe. This was the place fantasy fiction dared not go. Until now. Explore mankind's depravity in all its horror; the plight of the woman, the ignorance of the man, the tools of the prophet and the precious rarity of the hero. What goes on inside those minds? Through the work of R. Scott Bakker you will glimpse the human heart, blasted naked in its authenticity, set in a world our ancestors believed was real; a world of madness, of monsters, of sorcery and gods, but most all, a world of inconceivable, sprawling awe… Here you will learn that the true path to enlightenment is really the darkest path of all. For what is the truth when by mere virtue of having it, life loses all meaning?"

Anyone who gazes upon the Inverse Fire experiences Damnation. Seeing it drove [[Misariccas]] and [[Runidil]] mad, and drove [[Cet'ingira]] and [[Shaeönanra]] to join the [[Consult]]'s effort to shut the World against the [[Outside]] and so escape damnation.&lt;ref&gt;''The False Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the names [[skin-spies]] call themselves by is "Keepers of the Inverse Fire", but they do not appear to actually know what this refers to.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Misariccas''' was a [[Nonmen]] [[Ishroi]] who lived during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].

After their victory over the [[Inchoroi]], the Nonmen attempted in vain to destroy the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. Having learned of the Golden Court and the [[Inverse Fire]] from [[Nin'janjin]], [[Nil'giccas]] sent three to investigate it. Being famed for his valor, Misariccas was selected along with [[Runidil]] and [[Cet'ingira]]. However, after gazing upon the Inverse Fire and experiencing Damnation, Misariccas and Runidil fled shrieking, and Cet'ingira counselled Nil'giccas to have them executed&lt;ref&gt;''The False Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is famed as the creator of many powerful sorcerous artifacts, although some (particularly human historians) tend to attribute all Nonmen items of note to the Artisan. Several items created by the Artisan are known as the [[Sublime Contrivances]] for their place in fame: the [[Day Lantern]]{{EG2|Emilidis}}, [[Amiolas]]{{6|9}}, the [[Immaculate Rim]] and the [[Barricades]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Barricades'&lt;/ref&gt;. He is also credited with the creation of the [[Agonic Collar]]{{6|12}} and the blade [[Chipmunk]]{{6|17}}, but the provenance of the latter two items is less certain.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Sublime Contrivances'&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilidis's fate is unclear; he last appears to history having founded the Mihtrûl circa 661 Year-of-the-Tusk. In 1119 [[Titirga]], Grandmaster of the [[Sohonc]], referred to Emilidis as an acquaintance, indicating he was still alive at that time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1726">The '''Womb Plague''' was an epidemic that killed all the females of the [[Nonmen]].{{EG|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars}}

== Overview ==
In the hope of achieving immortality, the Nonmen (specifically, the great [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]]) allowed the [[Inchoroi]] to live among them as their physicians. The Inchoroi moved freely among the Nonmen, dispensing their remedies, and the Nonmen did in fact attain immortality. However, a plague struck shortly afterwards, almost killing males and uniformly killing all females. The Nonmen call this tragic event the Nasamorgas, the “Death of Birth.”

According to the ''[[Isûphiryas]],'' the first victim of the Womb Plague was [[Hanalinqû]], Cû’jara-Cinmoi’s legendary wife. The chronicler actually praises the diligence and skill of the High King’s Inchoroi physicians. But as the Womb Plague killed more and more Cûnuroi women, this praise becomes condemnation. Soon all the women of the Cûnuroi, wives and maidens both, were dying. The Inchoroi fled the Mansions, returning to their ruined vessel.{{EG|Cûno-Inchoroi Wars}}{{EG|Nonmen}}

In a Q/A the author explains the womb plague:

{{Blockquote|The simplest way to look at the Womb Plague is as a kluge. The Inchoroi are stuck with the remnants of a technology they can no longer understand. At the same time, think of what it is the [[No-God]], as a technology, yields the Inchoroi: the death of birth. They attempted to give immortality to their Nonmen allies to begin with, to save their souls, realized afterward that their gift was fatal to their women. This yielded a crude tool they needed to accomplish at least part of the No-God's function.}}

'''Apperens Saccarees''' is the Grandmaster of the School of [[Mandate]] at the time of the [[Great Ordeal]]. Aside from [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] and his daughter [[Anasûrimbor Serwa|Serwa]], only he is rumoured to have successfully recited a metagnostic cant.{{5|2}}

During the Great Ordeal as the Exalt-Magus, Saccarees is the first to see the [[Inchoroi]] rising above [[Urokkas|Mantigol]]. He laments that he should signal Kellhus as they had discussed this as their greatest peril.{{6|13}}

==Summary==
'''Early Summer, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], the [[Jiünati Steppe]]'''

[[Cnaiür urs Skiötha|Cnaiür]], Chieftain of the [[Utemot]], meets with the other [[Scylvendi]] chieftains, enraged that he had not been summoned for the war council. He knows that many of them heard the rumors of his [[Skiötha urs Hannut|father’s]] death long ago and that is the source of their contempt for him. He tells [[Xunnurit]], their King-of-Tribes, to exercise patience in dealing with [[Ikurei Conphas]], who has invaded the Steppe after a series of provocations against the Scylvendi. Xunnurit, however, thinks Cnaiür’s plan is overly-cautious and that they must attack immediately. Cnaiür relates how through patience, they had defeated the [[Kian|Kianese]] at [[Battle of Zirkirta|Zirkirta]]. [[Oknai One-Eye]], Chieftain of the [[Munuäti]], asks Cnaiür how long must they wait because the droughts will begin soon, and they need to drive their herds to summer pastures, and many chieftains agree with this. Cnaiür says that Conphas had brought lots of provisions because he also expects a war of patience. Xunnurit again dismisses Cnaiür’s advice and says that tomorrow, the Scylvendi will attack.

Riding to battle the next morning, Cnaiür wonders about Conphas’s plan, certain that there is something amiss. Cnaiür comes upon a ridge and studies the [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]] army, which remains close to their encampment rather than on the banks of the [[River Kiyuth]]. His uncle, [[Bannut urs Hannut|Bannut]], also wonders this. Cnaiür explains that Conphas wants a pitched battle and orders Bannut to go to Xunnurit and find out what he wants the Utemot to do. Bannut returns with another Utemot tribesman, [[Yursalka]], who tells Cnaiür that Xunnurit wants them to attack the Nansur’s left flank, which is composed of the Nasueret, rumored to be the finest soldiers in the Nansurium. The Scylvendi cross the Kiyuth and arrange themselves into a crescent without challenge, again making Cnaiür question what Conphas is planning. Before the Scylvendi charge, Bannut tells Cnaiür that he will be measured today and that “measure is unceasing.” Cnaiür is shocked, and tells his uncle that it is not the time to bring up old grudges.

Cnaiür leads the first wave of his Utemot into a charge against the Nansur. Cnaiür is unhorsed, and the Nansur ranks are largely unbroken. When he looks for the second wave, he sees that they remain behind. Suspecting treachery, Cnaiür rounds on Bannut, who tells him that he killed him to rid the Utemot of Cnaiür, who had been an accomplice to his father’s death as well lover to his killer. Cnaiür strangles him and rallies the surviving Utemot from the first charge. Their battle with the Nasueret draws the second wave to relieve them, and the Nasueret flee.

Cnaiür rushes to a hill and sees that the Nansur’s right flank is about to be overwhelmed while the Nansur’s camp is on fire. Then Cnaiür spots a Nansur column in the center that bears a Nasueret standard, and realizes Conphas had deceived them into believing their best troops were on the flanks, not the center. The Scylvendi’s own center has been driven to the other side of the Kiyuth. [[Balait urs Kututha|Balait]], Cnaiür’s brother-in-law, comes to him and says they need to reassemble and strike while the field is confused. Cnaiür tells him of his suspicions and that Conphas sacrificed his flanks so he could have the center.

Cnaiür understands Conphas’s plan: he knows that the [[Chorae]] bowmen were behind the Scylvendi center. As he tries to warn Balait, the [[Imperial Saik]] strike. Rising into the sky, the Schoolmen bathe charging Scylvendi in flames. The battle quickly becomes a rout for the Scylvendi. Cnaiür is protected from their magic by his Chorae, but Balait is burned to cinder.

Cnaiür flees toward the Kiyuth and sees Yursalka and other Utemot ride by. He calls out to Yursalka but he ignores him. As Cnaiür swims across the Kiyuth, cutting off his brigandine, something hits him in the head, and Cnaiür loses consciousness.

He regains consciousness, hearing three looters. He hides his Chorae in the mud, and pretends to be dead. One inspects him, finding nothing. He loses consciousness once more.

He wakes in the morning, and crawls away from the bank of the Kiyuth and rests upon a dead horse. He feels vindicated about his early misgivings. He thinks about Bannut’s words and wonders how many other Utemot think as his uncle had. Then he hears two men talking, and Cnaiür once again plays dead. He realizes that one of the men is Conphas. Cnaiür wants to rise and attack him, but stays, listening how Conphas relates to [[Martemus]] how he knew his tactics would work because the Scylvendi are static and that “war is intellect.” Conphas tells Martemus that the battle they fought was the first engagement of the [[Holy War]] and they leave.

Cnaiür thinks back to twenty-nine years ago. In the dimness of his father’s yaksh, his father and other tribesmen talk about the insolence of the [[Kuöti]]. A slave steps forward and proposes a wager to [[Skiötha urs Hannut|Skiöath]], shocking everyone but Cnaiür. Skiöath says that he has already failed his gambit, and the slave replies that he will wager his life against Skiöath and that everyone wonders about his strength. Skiöath laughs and says that he has already been measured. The slave replies that measure is unceasing, and Cnaiür, as instructed before by the slave, asks his father if he is afraid. Skiöath glares at him, and asks the slave, [[Anasûrimbor Moënghus|Moënghus]], what’s his wager. This leads to a duel where Skiöath is killed.

At night, Cnaiür flees, avoiding the Nansur pickets.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1313">The '''Reach''' is, very roughly speaking, the territory or sphere of influence surrounding a [[Nonmen|Nonman]] Mansion. The Nonmen did not place the same value on holding territory for its own sake that men later did, but did place a value on holding areas of interest or containing resources that were useful.

Many of the smaller Mansions had most Reaches restricted to the immediate vicinity of the Mansion. However, the Nine Great Mansions had considerably larger Reaches stretching across hundreds or even thousands of miles.

The greatest Reach in history was that of [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], the King of [[Siöl]]. At the height of his power he controlled Siöl, [[Viri]], [[Nihrimsul]] and [[Cil-Aujas]] and their combined Reaches. This created a land empire stretching from the northern [[Great Kayarsus]] west and north to the [[Yimaleti Mountains]], south to the [[Meneanor|Sea of Meneanor]] and west to the [[Demua Mountains]]. This may be the largest land empire in the histoy of [[Eärwa]], although far less populous than later empires of men.

Following the [[Breaking of the Gates]] and the resulting [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]], all of the Mansions and their Reaches were overrun and lost. The sole exception is [[Ishterebinth]], which controls a Reach known as [[Injor-Niyas]].

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2063">The '''Cûno-Halaroi Wars''' are a series of conflicts which began when the men - or ''halaroi'' - of [[Eänna]] invaded [[Eärwa]] through the [[Gates of Eärwa|Gates of Thayant]], a series of fortified passes through the northern [[Great Kayarsus]] Mountains. Some historians believe that the Gates of Thayant refer to the Mansion of [[Siöl]], which was located deep under the north-eastern Kayarsus Mountains, and the destruction of Siöl (formerly the strongest of the Mansions before the [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]]) marked the beginning of the end for the Nonmen.

The [[Five Tribes of Men|Four Tribes]] which invaded Eärwa - the [[Ketyai]], [[Norsirai]], [[Scylvendi]] and [[Satyothi]] - were following the teachings of [[Angeshraël]], the Burned Prophet, and the command of the [[The Chronicle of the Tusk]] to throw down the "False Men", or [[Nonmen]]. The Nonmen themselves had been weakened by close to a millennium of warfare with the [[Inchoroi]], as well as the loss of their women in the [[Womb Plague]], and were unable to resist the invading hordes of men. In the resulting conflicts, those Mansions which survived the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] were themselves thrown down and destroyed. The sole survivors were [[Ishterebinth]] and [[Cil-Aujas]].

The wars lasted for at least four centuries, until [[Nil’giccas]], the King of Ishterebinth, made peace with [[Cûnwerishau]], the God-King of [[Trysë]]. The [[Nonman Tutelage]], a prolonged period of peace and alliance between men and Nonmen, began in 555 Year-of-the-Tusk and saw the Nonmen impart knowledge of sorcery - even the [[Gnosis]] - to the nascent sorcerous schools. The Tutelage lasted until 825, when it was undone by an assault on the [[Ûmeri Empire|Ûmeri]] princess [[Anasûrimbor Omindalea|Omindalea]] by a Nonman [[Siqû]].

Cil-Aujas finally fell during the [[Apocalypse]], leaving Ishterebinth as the sole surviving Nonman mansion.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary (I and II), 'Cûno-Halaroi Wars', 'Breaking of the Gates'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
'''Mid-Spring, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], [[Momemn]]'''

On a triumph, [[Ikurei Conphas]] dismounts beneath the Xatantian Arch, [[Martemus]] at his side. He thinks that not even [[Surmante Xatantius I|Xatantius I]] had pacified the [[Scylvendi]]. His victory over them convinced Conphas that he is more than a man. Priests of [[Gilgaöl]] smear Conphas’s limbs with lion blood and wash it off, cleaning his symbolic wounds. To Conphas’s surprise, they are followed by Shrial Priests who anoint him in oil and proclaim him Shield-of-the-Tusk. He thinks that [[Skeaös]] had arranged this to tap into the Holy War fever. The Scylvendi are as heathen as the [[Kian]]ese.

The [[Battle of Kiyuth]] was a divine revelation to Conphas. After the battle, Conphas took Scylvendi captives and arranged for them to overhear his officers laud the tribes that had assisted the [[Nansur Empire|Nansur]]. He then allowed the captives to escape to ensure that the Scylvendi will not become unified for some time. His elation at the revelation dissipated over time, marked by disputes of his cartographers, mathematicians and [[Imperial Saik]] over the placing of the Scylvendi heads to Momemn. When he arrived in Momemn, he had expected cheering crowds, but instead found the rabble of the [[Holy War]] blocking his path. He used his [[Kidruhil]] to clear a path, and small battle ensued where twenty of his men were killed. Conphas was forced to enter [[Momemn]] by boat. So far, only three [[Great Names]] were in Momemn: [[Nersei Calmemunis|Calmemunis]], [[Heänar Tharschilka|Tharschilka]], and [[Akori Kumrezzer|Kumrezzer]].

Conphas hates the Holy War because it distracts from his victory over the Scylvendi. Conphas and Martemus march, his soldiers on either side of them. Behind them, his bodyguards drag his prisoner, while ahead, [[Ikurei Xerius III]] awaits in the [[Allosium Forum|Allosian Forum]]. Conphas thinks about how his [[Ikurei Istriya|grandmother]] prepared him for his birthright as Emperor of Nansur, raising him among the intrigue of the imperial court. He could almost love her for it. Conphas thinks that if all things were equal, he should have returned to Momemn to conquer it before his uncle could kill him as a rival. But the Battle of Kiyuth and the Holy War made Conphas more useful than dangerous to him.

He asks Martemus his opinion on what Xerius is thinking. Martemus thinks that he is frighten, and that Conphas should be afraid. Conphas dismisses this, saying that his uncle considers him an old fear, and that he needs him. Martemus says that Conphas accomplished much and that his army is willing to die for him, should that make him a new fear? Conphas thinks Marmetus is suggesting rebellion and is intrigued by this idea.

As they begin to climb the stairs, Conphas thinks about who would support his uncle in a coup. Stabbing him with his ceremonial dagger would be without malice. At the top of the stairs, Xerius proclaims that Conphas had brought glory to [[House Ikurei]]. Conphas is humble, but distant. He does not kiss his uncle’s knee. He prepares to kill Xerius, but he moves pass him, asking about Conphas’s naked prisoner. Conphas says he is [[Xunnurit]], the Scylvendi King-of-Tribes. Xerius says he will have him blinded, castrated and bound to his throne.

Conphas then notices his grandmother, finding that there is something different about her. She says that Conphas left an heir to an Empire and returned as a god, shocking everyone. Conphas replies humbly, but is thrilled. Conphas asks what Xerius is going to do with the Men of the Tusk, and Xerius says that matter has been concluded. Xerius says that Conphas and Istriya will accompany him upriver to see the transport of his new monument, and that Conphas must be patience; this is not Kiyuth and they are not the Scylvendi.

Conphas asks what he means, and Xerius says that he could not ferry enough of Conphas’s men into the city, so he dressed his own men as Conphas’s. Conphas kneels and kisses his uncle’s knee.


Xerius, Istriya and Conphas are on a galley sailing the [[River Phayus]]. It is the day after Conphas’s triumph. The transport of his monument is the ostentatious reason for their journey, and his true reason is to tell them his plans concerning the Holy War. Xerius grows annoyed at his mother’s constant doting over Conphas and wonders if she is trying to get him killed.

The galley suddenly stops after hitting a sandbar. The captain comes to Xerius to offer apologies. Xerius berates him and orders him taken below and whipped. Xerius suggests they retreat from the sun, and they go to the back of galley, where the canopy shades them. Conphas tells him that Men of the Tusk have sacked [[Jarutha]] and that the Nansur are at the brink of war. Istriya asks what Xerius is going to do.

Xerius tells them that Calmemunis will sign the [[Indenture]] tomorrow. Istriya is surprised, though Xerius thinks she is pretending. Conphas says the others will sign as well. They fear the arrival of the others and think themselves invincible with the [[God of Gods|God]] on their side. Why should they share the glory? Istriya tells Xerius to delay provisioning them to prevent them from marching. Xerius says they should march, and dismisses the slaves after Conphas’s suggestion.

Conphas says that the [[Padirajah]] had asked Xerius for a gesture. Xerius is shocked by his nephew’s penetration, and demands to know how he knew. Conphas says that is what he would do, and that [[Skauras ab Nalajan|Skauras]] and Kian needs to know that the Nansur are not fanatics. Xerius is not convinced, and threatens to send Conphas to [[Tower of Ziek|Ziek]]. Conphas admits Skauras told him and that he had always remained in contact with Kian. Istriya warns that Skauras will try to sow dissension in the Nansurium and tells them that House Ikurei is most important.

Xerius says that he will sacrifice a Holy War to recover the Nansur Empire’s lost lands. Istriya thinks he’s mad, but Conphas sees reason in the plan. Sacrificing the rabble of the Holy War will teach the Men of the Tusk to fear the [[Fanim]], which will increase their dependency to the Nansur Empire. Istriya asks what happens then. Xerius says that if [[Maithanet]] will have the Men of the Tusk sign the Indenture, he would give them Conphas. The Holy War will perish before it reaches [[Shimeh]].

==Summary==
'''Autumn, 4110 [[Year-of-the-Tusk]], the Northern [[Jiünati Steppe]]'''

[[Yursalka]] is awoken in his yaksh by a sound. He hears it again, realizing that someone is throwing stones at his yaksh. He thinks it’s his son, [[Ogatha urs Yursalka|Ogatha]], who was caught in the rains. Curious, but cautious, he rises, grabs his sword and steps outside. It is stormy. He picks up a stone and lightning flashes, revealing that the stone is actually a section of a child’s finger.

He looks around wildly and another lightning flash reveals [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha|Cnaiür]], standing a dozen yards from him. Cnaiür tells him he found his son wandering the Steppe and throws Ogatha’s head at Yursalka. Yursalka attacks him. Cnaiür blocks his attack and disembowels him. Yursalka falls to the muddy ground, and Cnaiür tells him that he is his end, that he will slaughter his children and blot of his name and legacy until he is nothing.

Other [[Utemot]] come from their tents, and Cnaiür tells them of Yursalka’s betrayal and dares anyone to challenge him. Yursalka’s family gather around him, and Cnaiür begins killing them. The Utemot do not interfere because it is their way of dealing with traitors.


'''Late Autumn, 4110 Year-of-the-Tusk, [[Momemn]]'''

[[Maithanet]]’s declaration of the [[Holy War]] half a year earlier had resulted in thousands arriving in Momemn. Such is the fervor that many men sold their wives and children to become Men of the Tusk. Some Men of the Tusk commit atrocities or are the victim to them.

[[Nersei Calmemunis|Calmemunis]], [[Heänar Tharschilka|Tharschilka]], and [[Akori Kumrezzer|Kumrezzer]] sign the [[Indenture]], and [[Ikurei Xerius III|Xerius III]] provisions them. However, there is no clear leader, no organization. This host, which comes to be called the [[Vulgar Holy War]], departs Momemn. Maithanet is angry, and the main contingents of the Holy War are ready to begin their journey to Momemn. [[Incheiri Gotian|Gotian]], Grandmaster of the [[Shrial Knights]], intercepts the Vulgar Holy War north of [[Gielgath]] with a summons to Maitanet, but Calmemunis refuses the answer, finding it troubling that the [[Shriah]] is having doubts on the [[God of Gods|God’s]] judgement.

The Vulgar Holy War continue south at a slow pace, attracting camp followers. By time it reaches [[Anserca]], the host has become more unruly and raids the countryside for food. General [[Martemus]], who has been shadowing the Vulgar Holy War, attempts to restrain them, but is driven back. Calmemunis blames Xerius for the stop of supplies, but Maithanet ordered the edicts to compel the Vulgar Holy War back to Momemn. He also issues other edicts, rescinding the Shrial Remission, and threatening Shrial Censure to all in the Vulgar Holy War should they continue to march.

These events cause the host to stop, and for a time, the [[Great Names]] think about returning to Momemn. However, they come across a supply train, apparently heading to [[Asgilioch]]. Seeing it as a sign of the God, the Vulgar Holy War continue its march, though some return to Momemn. The host eventually comes upon Asgilioch. The commander of the fortress, [[Harus Prophilas|Prophilas]], offers dinner invitations to the Great Names, and they accept after receiving hostages. Within Asgilioch, they are arrested and presented with the Shriah’s Warrant, but Calmemunis warns Prophilas that the God is on his side, and quotes [[Inri Sejenus]] about those who interfere with the God’s will. Prophilas releases them, and the Vulgar Holy War crosses the [[Unaras Spur|Unaras Mountains]] into [[Fanim]] lands.


While [[Ikurei Conphas|Conphas]] is writing a message, [[Skeaös]] comes to him, telling him that the [[High Ainon|Ainoni]] have arrived. Conphas is surprised; they were not expected for another day. Since the departure of the Vulgar Holy War, ten thousand [[Thunyerus|Thunyeri]] and forty thousand [[Ce Tydonn|Tydonni]] have arrived, but the respective leaders of the contingents, King [[Hringa Rauschang|Rauschang]] and [[Hoga Gothyelk|Gothyelk]], refused to sign the [[Indenture]]. Conphas hands his message to his dispatch, an order for Martemus to resume his patrols south of Momemn.

Conphas had installed himself at the lowest level of the [[Andiamine Heights]], and he and Skeaös make the climb up to where his uncle is meeting the Ainoni. Conphas notes that Skeaös shows no sign of strain during the long climb. Skeaös briefs him on their way to the Privy Council, and says that Xerius wanted to exclude Conphas until [[Hanamanu Eleäzaras|Eleäzaras]] requested his presence. Conphas makes Skeaös tell him how critical he is to his uncle’s plans and demands to know why he had lied. Skeaös says that he fears for his soul.

Conphas wonders if Skeaös is conspiring with his [[Ikurei Istriya|grandmother]] to sow dissension between Conphas and Xerius to save the Holy War. Conphas tells Skeaös that the restoration the [[Nansur Empire]] for his soul is a bargain.


In the Privy Chamber, Xerius dismisses everyone but [[Cememketri]], Skeaös and Conphas. He asks Conphas how he means to snare Eleäzaras. Conphas knows his uncle is afraid because no one knows why the [[Scarlet Spires]] have joined the Holy War. Conphas says that they know too little to snare him and it is best to bargain in good faith, and Xerius says that is his thought as well. Eleäzaras and [[Chepheramunni]] are announced into the room.

Xerius asks why have the Scarlet Spires joined the Holy War, and Eleäzaras says it’s because they were purchased. Conphas thinks this is a lie because even the [[Thousand Temples]] could not afford such a price. Eleäzaras says that Chepheramunni will sign the Indenture, but several conditions must be met first. Xerius protests, and Eleäzaras interrupts him, saying he heard his arguments. He asks why had they provisioned the Vulgar Holy War. Xerius says to end their depredations, and Eleäzaras says that is unlikely and that they wanted the Vulgar Holy War destroyed to gain control of the Holy War. He says that if the Nansur should betray them, nothing would save them for the Scarlet Spire’s wrath. Xerius turns to Skeaös and Cememketri warns that Eleäzaras is far from High Ainon to make threats. Eleäzaras ignores him, turning to address Conphas. He praises his unprecedented victory over the [[Scylvendi]]. Conphas smiles, but tells him that Cememketri is right; by joining the Holy War, the Scarlet Spires will be surrounded by fanatics. They’ll need every friend they can get. Eleäzaras says they need no one.

During their negotiation, Conphas becomes convinced that the reason the Scarlet Spires joined the Holy War is because they have been in a secret war with the [[Cishaurim]]. Eleäzaras demanded that in exchange for Chepheramunni signing the Indenture, the Nansur must surrender all their intelligence of the Cishaurim to the Scarlet Spires. Conphas thinks that Maithanet had to know of the Scarlet Spires’ war, and wonders what game he is playing.


Conphas receives news that the Vulgar Holy War had been [[Fourth Battle of Mengedda|annihilated]] on the [[Mengedda Plains|Plains of Mengedda]]. Two couriers came to Momemn, one delivering the heads of Calmemunis, Tharschilka, and Kumrezzer, and another delivering Conphas a secret message from [[Skauras ab Nalajan|Skauras]]: &lt;em&gt;We cannot count the carcasses of your idolatrous kin, so many have been felled by the fury of our righteous hand. Praised be the Solitary God. Know that House Ikurei has been heard.&lt;/em&gt;

Conphas is awed by what he and his uncle had accomplished, and that only Gods could do such an act.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3008">A '''Mansion''' is a [[Nonman]] stronghold, city and fortress, typically subterranean or built into the interior of large mountains or hill. At their height the Nonmen established dozens of such settlements across [[Eärwa]], stretching right across the continent.

[[File:Nine_Great_Mansions.jpg|thumb|450px|The Nine Great Mansions before Arkfall.]]

The centres of Nonmen culture and society were the '''Nine Great Mansions''', named and located as follows:

* [[Siöl]] - Located in the north-eastern [[Great Kayarsus]] Mountains, guarding a series of fortified passes leading to the eastern continent of [[Eänna]]. Some historians believe that Siöl may be the location of the [[Breaking of the Gates]] and the entry of Men into [[Eärwa]] in substantial numbers.
* [[Nihrimsul]] or Nihrimsûl - Located on the southern-most spur of the eastern [[Yimaleti Mountains]]. Founded independently from Siöl by the ancestors of the Nonmen.
* [[Ishoriöl]] or Ishterebinth - Located west of the [[Demua Mountains]] and south of the [[Leash]]. Founded by Siöl.
* [[Viri]] - Located south-west of Nihrimsul under the mountainous peak of [[Antareg]] in the [[Urokkas]], overlooking the [[Neleöst]]. Founded by Siöl.
* [[Illisserû]] or The Lighthouse - Located under the [[Betmulla Mountains]], founded by Siöl. Later renamed [[Orovelai]], the stronghold of the [[Swayal Compact]] in the years after the [[Holy War]]. The second Mansion to be settled by men (or, in this case, women).
* [[Cil-Aujas]] - Located under the mountainous peak of [[Aenaratiol]] in the [[Osthwai Mountains]]. Founded by Siöl.
* [[Curunq]] - Located in the [[Araxes Mountains]]. Founded in the second wave of Nonman expansion from those Mansions founded by Siöl.
* [[Incissal]] - Located near the modern city of [[Domyot]] in [[Zeüm]]. Founded in the second wave. The first Mansion to be settled by men.
* [[Cil-Aumûl]] - Located in the [[Hinayati Mountains]]. Founded in the second wave.

Other Mansions were founded, such as the one found just a few hours from [[Shimeh]], but these were of a significantly lesser order and generally held fealty to one of the Nine.

Siöl claimed to be the First Mansion, the ancestral home of all Nonmen, founded directly by the progenitors of the Nonmen race in a time so ancient as to defy reckoning. For this reason Siöl took the title "House Primordial", a term used to refer to both the Mansion and its ruling family. Extant records support this, tracing a line of founding from Siöl to first Ishoriöl, Viri, Illisserû, and Cil-Aujas. Those Mansions turn later founded Curunq, Incissal, and Cil-Aumûl. Nihrimsul was founded separately and outside of this line of descent, although its claim to have originally founded Siöl (and thus being the true House Primordial) was hotly denied by Siöl.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, ‘Cûno-Inchoroi Wars’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Nine Mansions'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="893">'''Incissal''' is a [[Nonman]] [[Mansion]], founded in the second wave of Nonman expansion from [[Siöl]]. It was located in the far west of [[Eärwa]] in what is now [[Zeüm]], in or under hill ranges close to the modern city of [[Domyot]].

Incissal was destroyed in the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]] following the [[Breaking of the Gates]]. Based on its distance from the Gates, it may have been one of the last Mansions to fall. It was likely sacked by the [[Satyothi]] as they established Angkha, the forerunner to Zeüm.

Unlike every other Mansion, Incissal was actually captured and inhabited after its fall, becoming an outpost of Zeüm. Four millennia later, the Mansion of [[Illisserû]] was likewise repurposed and settled, becoming the stronghold of the [[Swayal Compact]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Illisseru', 'Orevalai'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="944">The '''Leash''' is the name given to the narrow waterway linking the northern [[Great Ocean]] to the [[Neleöst]], the Misty Sea of the [[Ancient North]]. In ancient times it was known as the '''Straits of Aögus''' but this name fell out of favour, with '''Ogni''', a [[Condic]] term meaning "Leash" replacing it.

The Leash was wide enough to permit passage between the two major seas, but narrow enough to be crossed by raft or boat. It was even shallow enough to permit large numbers of [[sranc]] to pass across it.

During the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] the [[Nonmen]] of [[Illisserû]] mounted a seaborne assault on [[Golgotterath]] via the Leash, but this was defeated at the [[Battle of Imogirion]]. Barely a hundred warriors survived to flee back to their ships, but most of the fleet was lost at sea during the long voyage back to the [[Three Seas]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult''&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1259">'''Illisserû''', also called '''The Lighthouse''' (in [[Aujic]]) or '''Orovelai''' is a [[Nonman]] [[Mansion]] located in an outcropping of the [[Betmulla Mountains]], overlooking [[Trantis Bay]]. It was founded by [[Siöl]].

Illisserû was unusual in that its inhabitants were of a maritime inclination. "Sepil himi loi’nu muomi," the nameless poet of Six-Skins-Foldedwrites of the Illisserû: "The Sea is their Deepest Deep." The Illisseri love of the sea is the primary reason they remain at the margins of Nonman lore as inherited by the Three Seas.

During the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], Illisserû attempted a surprise seaborne assault on [[Golgotterath]]. This was defeated at the [[Battle of Imogirion]], with less than 100 of the Mansion's warriors surviving. Only one, [[Moryror]], lived to see home. The Mansion recovered somewhat, economically even surpassing Siöl for a time, but was finally sacked and abandoned during the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]].

After the [[Holy War]], the ruins of Illisserû were reoccupied by the witches of the [[Swayal Compact]], who took it as their stronghold and headquarters, renaming it "Orovelai".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Illisserû', 'Orovelai',&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3666">The '''Arkfall''' is the name given to the arrival of the [[Incû-Holoinas]] upon [[the World]]. This is the most significant event in recorded history, sparking the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], the near-ruination of [[Nonman]] civilisation, the arrival of Men in [[Eärwa]] and ultimately the onset of the [[Apocalypse]].

==Prelude==
The Arkfall was heralded by a sudden waxing of the star Imburil, which men later called the [[Nail of Heaven]]. The star burned with remarkable ferocity for a brief period before returning to normal. Three years later, Arkfall took place.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Ordeal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fall==
The Incû-Holoinas was a spacefaring vessel containing the dread Inchoroi. According to some reports, the Ark had visited numerous worlds and unleashed destruction on a titanic scale on each occasion before resuming its journey. It is unclear if the Ark had landed on each world or merely visited destruction from above each time. The reason for the Ark's uncontrolled descent onto the World is unknown, although the Inchoroi did report it as an unintended accident.

The Ark's arrival in north-western Eärwa visited enormous destruction upon the planet. An immense crack, known as the Displacement, was riven straight through the Nonman stronghold of [[Ishterebinth]] and the foundations of [[Cil-Aujas]], over two thousand miles away, were briefly shaken. The skies turned red over the continent. However, the most devastating impact was felt in [[Viri]], the Nonman [[Mansion]] located closest to the catastrophe. The verdant forests and plains in Viri's western [[Reach]] were completely destroyed, and the walls of the Mansion were scorched by the heat. All of the lands between the [[River Sursa]] and the [[Yimaleti Mountains]] were laid waste, becoming a desolate, utterly lifeless plain known as the [[Agongorea]], or Field Appalling.

Tens of thousands of Nonmen alone were killed in Viri by the earthquakes and tremors unleashed by the Arkfall. The death toll amongst the Halaroi, the vassal-men of Viri, was certainly far greater. The destruction of Viri's farmlands and supplies resulted in King [[Nin’janjin]] calling upon [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] of [[Siöl]] for aid. Cû’jara-Cinmoi invaded and occupied Viri and sent the great warrior [[Ingalira]] to investigate the cause of Arkfall.

Ingalira reported that a great molten lake had formed on the site of the cataclysm, with two immense golden horns towering many thousands of feet into the sky. He also found two survivors of the crash, creatures of obscene aspect who made noises devoid of meaning. He dubbed them "Inchoroi", or "People of Emptiness". Cû’jara-Cinmoi ordered the two wretches executed on the spot. These events eventually led to the Inchoroi-Viri alliance, the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]] and the Cûno-Inchoroi Wars that would consume the fate of the Nonmen for the next several centuries.

==Dating==
The Arkfall took place a considerable amount of time before the [[Breaking of the Gates]], the arrival of the [[Five Tribes of Men|Four Tribes]] in Eärwa and the overthrow of Nonman civilisation. According to the ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'', the Breaking took place 4,132 years before the [[Great Ordeal]] began its march on [[Golgotterath]]. The length of time that elapsed between Arkfall and the Breaking is difficult to fathom. At least one Nonman who lived through the period stated that eight thousand years have passed in total (four thousand years before the Breaking), but given his [[Erratic]] nature the accuracy of this figure is highly debatable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term used to distinguish everyday physical reality from the metaphysical realm of the [[Outside]].

According to the [[Inchoroi]], the World is one of countless planets located in the universe, many circling other stars. Philosophers and priests fiercely deny this, preferring an interpretation that the Inchoroi themselves are [[Ciphrang]] from the Outside since this would fall within their pre-existing frame of reference rather than require the introduction of new concepts and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, ''Incû-Holoinas''&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1291">The '''Thousand Year Siege''' or '''One-Thousand-Year Siege''' was a legendary conflict that erupted between [[Siöl]] and [[Nihrimsul]], two of the High [[Mansion|Mansions]] of the [[Nonmen]], in the millennia preceding [[Arkfall]].

Siöl had long claimed pre-eminence among the High Mansions, proclaiming itself the "House Primordial", the wellspring from which Nonmen civilisation spread across [[Eärwa]] under the rule of the [[House of Tsonos]]. However, this claim was disputed by Nihrimsul, which claimed to be the true "House Primordial" and that Tsonos has been banished from Nihrimsul for the murder of his father [[Imimorûl]], the progenitor of the Nonman species (according to the ''[[Isûphiryas]]''). Although denying such a claim, Siöl did agree that Nihrimsul stood apart from the other Mansions (which shared the blood of Tsonos) and used this as a justification for repeated conflict and war.

Nihrimsul endured the Thousand Year Siege intact, the conflict apparently ending with Siöl abandoning the siege. The true length of the siege and when precisely it happened - given the lack of a dating methodology relatable to men in the ''Isûphiryas'' - remain wholly conjectural.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Siöl'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">'''Imimorûl''' is, in the [[Nonman]] tradition, the progenitor and father-creator of the Nonman race, from whom all Nonmen are descended. He is named in ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'' as '''Father of the False'''.

In the ''Chronicle of the Tusk'' Imimorûl is presented as a once-glorious [[Gods|God]] who was exiled from the heavens and entombed far below the earth for the crime of teaching [[sorcery]] to the Nonmen. This is disputed by the Nonmen, who claim that Imimorûl sought refuge in the "Deepest Deeps" as a way of evading the eyes - and thus the judgement - of the Gods.{{EG2|Imimorûl}}

According to Nonman scripture, Imimorûl fell in love with the beauty of [[the World]] and fled from the "starving sky" to live in the deeps. He cut pieces from his flesh and implanted them in the wombs of lions, which resulted in the creation of sons and daughters.{{EG2|Psalm of Imimorûl}}

In the legends of [[Siöl]], Imimorûl founded their [[Mansion]] directly and died of advanced age, succeeded peacefully by his eldest son, [[Tsonos]]. This account was heavily disputed by [[Nihrimsul]], which instead claimed that Imimorûl founded and ruled their Mansion first. Tsonos and his sister [[Olissis]], who were lovers as well as siblings, murdered Imimorûl in his sleep and fled in terror of their siblings to found Siöl.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Nihrimsul'&lt;/ref&gt; This disputed account led to millennia of discord between the two Mansions, leading to the [[Thousand Year Siege]] and the later conflict between King [[Sin'niroiha]] of Nihrimsul and King [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] of Siöl.

The time when Imimorûl lived is unfathomable, except it was certainly many thousands and potentially tens of thousands of years before [[Arkfall]].

==The Psalm of Imimorûl==
The World to him, who sings my song,&lt;br /&gt;
for I am the Font, the Spirit of the Deepest Deep,&lt;br /&gt;
and mine is the first heart to beat your blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who sings my song.&lt;br /&gt;
I, Imimorul, fled the Heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
so much did I love&lt;br /&gt;
the brooks that chirrup,&lt;br /&gt;
the high mountains that hiss,&lt;br /&gt;
the myriads that bolt through this blessed hair,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who raises up&lt;br /&gt;
rooves in the Deep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I, Imimorul, did flee the Starving [sky],&lt;br /&gt;
so much did I fear the Heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
the wrath of those who were wroth,&lt;br /&gt;
who would forbid my love,&lt;br /&gt;
of the myriads of the World.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to her, who kindles her fire in the Deep.&lt;br /&gt;
I, Imimorul, did cut from my hand my fingers,&lt;br /&gt;
and from my arm, my hand,&lt;br /&gt;
and from my body, my arm,&lt;br /&gt;
and these pieces of me I did place&lt;br /&gt;
in the wombs of Lions,&lt;br /&gt;
so that I might dwell content in my own company.&lt;br /&gt;
And I became One-Armed, Imimorul, the Unshielded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And you were as children to me, the form of Gods as the issue of Lions,&lt;br /&gt;
sons who would father nations, and&lt;br /&gt;
daughters who would mother the&lt;br /&gt;
myriads of the World.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I sang to you such songs&lt;br /&gt;
as are only heard in the highest of Heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
and nowhere in the Hells.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We did weep together, as we sang,&lt;br /&gt;
for woe cares not for names or glory&lt;br /&gt;
only that skin blackens for bruising,&lt;br /&gt;
breaks for blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who sings my song.&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, who finds me in the Deep.&lt;br /&gt;
The World to him, and woe.{{EG2|Psalm of Imimorûl}}

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">'''Tsonos''' was the son of [[Imimorûl]] and brother of [[Olissis]]. He is recounted in [[Nonman]] history as the Ur-King of [[Siöl]] and the founder of the '''House of Tsonos'''. All Nonmen [[Mansion|Mansions]] bar [[Nihrimsul]] trace their ancestry to Tsonos, and his bloodline is seen as a prerequisite to legitimacy for Nonman nobility and royalty.

In most accounts, Tsonos was the mortal son of Imimorûl, born from the body of a lion, in which had been placed parts of Imimorûl's body. Imimorûl founded Siöl in the Deepest Deeps under the [[Great Kayarsus]] and died of advanced years, to be succeeded by Tsonos. It is known that Tsonos and his sister [[Olissis]] were lovers and their story was tragic (the controversial relationship between [[Cet'moyol]] and [[Linqirû]], parents of [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], draws some parallels&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Cû’jara-Cinmoi'&lt;/ref&gt;).

This account was heavily disputed by [[Nihrimsul]], which claimed to be the ''true'' House Primordial founded directly by Imimorûl. In this tradition, the relationship between Tsonos and Olissis was regarded as scandalous and obscene. Fearing their father, they murdered him in his sleep and fled from Nihrimsul to found a redoubt and place of safety, which grew into Siöl. This account was denied by Siöl, which made war upon Nihrimsul several times for the insult.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Nihrimsul'&lt;/ref&gt;

==The House of Tsonos==
The House or Bloodline of Tsonos refers to the Nonman line of descent from Tsonos (and presumably Olissis). Since Siöl founded [[Ishoriöl]], [[Viri]], [[Illisserû]] and [[Cil-Aujas]], which in turn founded [[Curunq]], [[Incissal]] and [[Cil-Aumûl]], the blood of Tsonos ran through all of the High Mansions save only Nihrimsul. This led to both the lengthy conflicts between Siöl and Nihrimsul and also the antipathy held by all the other Nonmen towards Nihrimsul, who were derided as "Dark Nonmen". During the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], King [[Sin'niroiha]] of Nihrimsul and Ishoriöl inherited the high command of the Nonmen armies against the [[Inchoroi]], but his lack of Tsonos blood seems to have resulted in disputes to his leadership. This problems disappeared when his son [[Nil'giccas]] inherited the rule, since his Tsonos blood (from his mother) gave him a legitimacy his father lacked.

After the end of the wars the Mansions became more distant and distinct from one another, their shared blood no longer an impediment to conflict and dispute. This period (of uncertain length) ended with the [[Breaking of the Gates]] and the destruction of first Siöl and then Nihrimsul at the hands of men, although much of the population of the latter had already removed to Ishoriöl. There they were also joined by survivors from Siöl, thus reuniting the discordant bloodlines in one Mansion.

The '''Battle of Pir Minginnial''' or '''Second Battle of the Ark''' was a crucial engagement during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], marking the resumption of hostilities between [[Nonmen]] and [[Inchoroi]] following the long truce of the [[Inoculation]]. It is accounted the bloodiest battle and must grievous defeat in Nonman history, notable for the sheer number of great heroes who perished during its course, most notably [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] himself. For this reason the engagement is simply called '''The Battle''' in many Nonman traditions. The battle also saw the first deployment of [[Chorae]], [[Sranc]], [[Bashrag|Bashrags]] and [[Wracu]] in combat.

==Prelude==
Following the devastating [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], the Inchoroi were forced to retreat to the [[Incû-Holoinas]] and dwelt there [[Second Watch|under siege]] for many decades. Eventually they sent their envoy [[Nin’janjin]], the Traitor-King of [[Viri]], to sue for peace with Cû’jara-Cinmoi, High King of [[Siöl]]. Cû’jara-Cinmoi, who was nearing the end of his life, was amazed to see that his old foe had not aged a day since Pir Pahal, and learned that the Inchoroi had a way of defeating death. Overruling the advice of his counsellors, the High King agreed to a truce as long as the Inchoroi shared the secret of immortality with the Nonmen.

For more than a century the Inchoroi moved amongst the Nonman [[Mansion|Mansions]], dispensing the Inoculation. Only one Nonman King, [[Sin’niroiha]] of [[Nihrimsul]] and [[Ishoriöl]], rejected the treatment. The Nonmen indeed became immortal and deathless. But then the [[Womb Plague]] began, slaying every single Nonman female. When the deaths began, the Inchoroi physicians appeared to work tirelessly to save them, but Cû’jara-Cinmoi became suspicious when reports reached him of Inchoroi evacuating [[Eärwa]], falling back to the Incû-Holoinas. The Nonmen realised the depth of their betrayal when it became clear that their female kin were dying in approximately the same order they received the Inoculation.

With the death of [[Hanalinqû]], his own beloved, Cû’jara-Cinmoi called for the total extermination of the Inchoroi and made alliance with all of the High Kings, even his hated nemesis Sin’niroiha. They assembled potentially the largest Nonman army in history - thirty thousand souls&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt; - and marched on the Pit of Obscenities.

==Course of the Battle==
Cû’jara-Cinmoi deployed his army on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]], the Black Furnace Plain immediately ringing Min-Uroikas and the Golden Horns of the Incû-Holoinas. He placed his wife's corpse before the unholy Ark (it is unclear in the ''[[Isûphiryas]]'' whether this was literal or figurative) and demanded that the Inchoroi answer his fury. In response the Inchoroi unleashed their creations: Sranc, Bashrags and Wracu in terrible numbers.

The Nonmen were taken by surprise, believing that they would be fighting the much-reduced Inchoroi and perhaps a few traitor Nonmen, survivors of the first battle at Pir Pahal. They rallied swiftly, finding that the Sranc were easily dispatched by sinew and sorcery, the Bashrags by their finest [[Ishroi]] warriors and even the fearsome Wracu were checked by the most powerful [[Qûya]]. However, they had no answer for the Inchoroi and their [[spears of light]]. The Inchoroi floated above the battlefield, cloaked in the first Chorae (and thus rendered immune to Nonman sorcery) and sweeping the ground with their weapons, killing hundreds of Nonmen.

Despite their dire predicament, the Nonmen rallied and slew many significant Inchoroi and their allies: [[Wutteät]], the Father of Dragons and [[Vshikcrû]], a powerful Inchoroi warrior were both killed, dismaying the foe (although Wutteät later re-emerged in history, suggesting a faulty record of events). Just when it seemed that the battle might turn, Nin'janjin slew Cû’jara-Cinmoi and beheaded him. The Copper Tree banner fell from the astonished grasp of the standard-bearer [[Mimotil]] (later called Cravenhearted for the loss of the banner)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and fell into the hordes of teeming Sranc. The Nonmen almost broke, with the great heroes [[Gin’gûrima]], [[Ingalira]] and [[Oirinas]] dying in short order, but Sin’niroiha was able to rally them and lead a fighting retreat into the [[Ring Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary I &amp; II, 'Cûno-Inchoroi Wars'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
The battle was accounted the greatest disaster in the history of Nonman civilisation, save for the Womb-Plague and [[Arkfall]] itself, but even so it fell far short of the complete victory the Inchoroi craved. Although their new weapons have performed well, they had fallen short of expectations and many of them had been destroyed: although the Sranc's prodigious breeding ability soon replenished their losses, the Bashrags and Wracu were harder to replace and the killed Inchoroi of course were irreplaceable. Although Cû’jara-Cinmoi and several significant Nonman heroes had been killed, they had also been replaced. Rather than the total rout the Inchoroi had expected, the Nonmen had withdrawn in good order (at least until they were out of danger) and remained capable of giving battle. Indeed, during the following five centuries the Inchoroi suffered numerous defeats, especially once their [[Tekne]] resources were exhausted and they lost the ability to create new weapons of light or weapon-races.

The battle was the bloodiest fought on the Black Furnace Plain by Nonmen (although some hold that the later [[Battle of Isal’imial]] may have matched it), but it was later outclassed by several battles fought by men: the [[First Ordeal]]'s [[First Investiture]] of Golgotterath ended in a great rout and slaughter. Greater still was the end of the [[Second Investiture]], when the [[Consult]] were able to trigger the event known as [[Initiation]], the summoning of the [[No-God]] and the utter annihilation of the besieging army of [[Sag-Marmau]].

The '''Battle of Isal'imial''', also called the '''Abandon''', was the last great battle of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], marking the end of five centuries of slaughter which began with the [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]]. It saw the [[Nonmen]] finally avenge the [[Womb Plague]] by destroying the last of the [[Inchoroi]] and driving even the teeming hordes of [[Sranc]] to the edge of extinction. It was the greatest victory and achievement of [[Nil’giccas]], the High King of [[Ishoriöl]].

==Prelude==
The Battle of Pir Minginnial was a spectacular victory for the Inchoroi, but not as complete as they had hoped. King [[Sin’niroiha]] was able to rally the Nonmen forces after the death of [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] and deliver them from the immediate vicinity of the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. However, the Nonmen forces scattered to defend their own [[Mansions]], leaving Ishoriöl vulnerable to counter-attack. The [[Mansion]] endured five sieges of a decade apiece, during one of which Sin’niroiha died of old age and was succeeded by Nil'giccas, before the Inchoroi forces were defeated.

Part of the chaos and slaughter of this time was caused by the Nonmen's piecemeal response to the threat of the Inchoroi, exemplified by the [[Battle of Imogirion]], when the southern Mansion of [[Illisserû]] attempted a stealth attack by sea against the Incû-Holoinas. Although a reasonable stratagem, it was not attempted in concert with any other offensive and the invading force was soon thrown back into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Battle of Imogirion'&lt;/ref&gt; The Nonmen refused to rally with enthusiasm to Sin’niroiha's banner, perhaps a vestigial belief in the Nihrimsuli inferiority due to their lack of [[Tsonos]] blood. When Nil'giccas succeeded him as a Son of Tsonos (through his mother's line), this issue was resolved.

Nil'giccas assembled a new coalition of Nonmen forces, eventually amassing a host to almost rival that which Cû’jara-Cinmoi had led to Pir Minginnial. The Inchoroi offensive had stalled due to the rapidly spreading failure of their [[Tekne]] artefacts, particularly their [[spears of light]] which had wrecked great slaughter on the Nonmen. Their Sranc hordes were dangerous in numbers, but vulnerable to [[Qûya]] sorcery. Eventually Nil'giccas and his new offensive were able to roll back the Inchoroi forces to the unholy Ark.

==Course of the Battle==
Precise details of the battle are lacking, although casualties were heavy, some reports suggest as heavy as Pir Minginnial. However, Nil'giccas and his forces were able to achieve a staggering victory. The Inchoroi were slaughtered, it was believed to an obscenity, and the [[Bashrag|Bashrags]] and [[Wracu]] were driven from the field in disarray. The Sranc were visited with destruction on a colossal scale, finally routed from the field and forced to seek sanctuary in the [[Yimaleti Mountains]]. The Nonmen then stormed the Incû-Holoinas itself, rooting out the foe from their hiding places and exterminating them.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Battle of Isal'imial'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the battle, Nil'giccas ordered his forces to cleanse the Ark. This was easier said than done, given the Ark's sheer size and many disturbing aspects. The Nonmen spent twenty years scouring the Ark from top to bottom, finally concluding that they had killed every servant of the foe within.

The most problematic aspect of the Ark to deal with was the [[Golden Room]], which Nin'janjin had spoken of to Nil'giccas. The Room was said to hold a secret, the "[[Inverse Fire]]" which would reveal the truth to anyone who gazed into it. Fearing it to be some kind of trap or artifact of possession, Nil'giccas ordered the famed Ishroi [[Misariccas]] and [[Runidil]] and the Qûya [[Cet’ingira]] to secure the Room. Upon their return, Misariccas and Runidil wept and shrieked. Cet'ingira counselled that they be killed because they had been driven mad by what they had seen. Fearing what would become of other Nonmen if they went into the Room, Nil'giccas ordered the evacuation of the Ark and commanded [[Emilidis]] to fashion the [[Barricades]] to prevent entry into the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nonman victory was almost, but not quite, complete. Two Inchoroi - [[Aurang]] and [[Aurax]] - had survived and they would deliver to the men of [[Eänna]] a fell command (via [[The Chronicle of the Tusk|scripture]]) for them to invade [[Eärwa]] and slaughter the Nonmen. Centuries, or possibly millennia, later, this action came to pass in the [[Breaking of the Gates]] and the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]].

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">[[File:Heronspear.jpg|thumb|400px|An Inchoroi spear of light, specifically the Heron Spear.]]The '''spears of light''' are [[Inchoroi]] weapons of staggering destructive power. Created with the long-lost secrets of the [[Tekne]], the spears are long and tipped with projections from which beams of light can be "cast". These beams are immensely destructive, able to slice through any known material. They inflict searing heat in the vicinity of the beam.

The spears of light were used liberally by the Inchoroi at the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], but their power was checked by [[Nonmen]] sorcery. The most notable weapon was Suörgil, "Shining Death", known to men as the [[Heron Spear]]. It was wielded by the Inchoroi King, [[Sil]], until he was slain by [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], High King of [[Siöl]]. Cû’jara-Cinmoi took up the weapon and wielded it in battle himself.

The Inchoroi deployed spears of light in unprecedented numbers during the [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]]. The fate of the Heron Spear itself in this battle is unclear, but it is likely that [[Sin’niroiha]] was able to recover it and return it to [[Ishoriöl]], where it was maintained in state for millennia. The weapon was stolen from Ishoriöl by [[Cet’ingira]] and restored to [[Golgotterath]] circa 750 Year-of-the-Tusk. It was stolen back by [[Seswatha]] and [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]] in 2140. The weapon was feared lost at the [[Battle of Eleneöt Fields]], but in reality it was taken to safety by [[Anaxophus V]], High King of [[Kyraneas]]. In 2154 Anaxophus and his army forced the [[No-God]] to take the field directly at the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]], where Anaxophus cast a beam from the Heron Spear that apparently penetrated the Sarcophagus and killed the No-God outright, ending the [[Apocalypse]]. The Heron Spear resided in [[Cenei]] for many centuries before it was lost in the [[Scylvendi]] sack of the city in 3351. The weapon's current whereabouts is unknown.

The other spears of light gradually ceased functioning, apparently denuded of power. By the time of the [[Battle of Isal’imial]], they had ceased functioning altogether, apart from one.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Cûno-Inchoroi Wars'&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sun Lance]], the personal weapon of the Inchoroi [[Aurang]], was preserved and was used during the [[Siege of Ishterebinth]] during the [[Apocalypse|First Apocalypse]]. It survived until the [[Great Ordeal]]'s assault on Golgotterath, when a Nonman sniper used it against the attacking army, inflicting significant casualties. [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] seized the weapon and used it to topple the Canted Horn, killing uncounted numbers of [[sranc]]. The fate of the weapon after that point is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1335">The '''Initiation''' was an event that took place during the [[First Apocalypse]], in 2142. The nature of the event is still fiercely debated by scholars and sorcerers of the [[Mandate]].

The event took place during the [[Second Investiture]], when the armies of [[Kûniüri]] and allied states under the command of General [[Sag-Marmau]] besieged [[Golgotterath]]. Agents of the [[Consult]] had allegedly murdered [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]] and hoped this would throw the armies of Kûniüri into dismay; instead, they rallied and inflicted crippling defeats on the Consult and were able to throw them back to the Golden Horns themselves. The forces of Sag-Marmau were preparing for a final offensive when the Consult triggered the creation of a destructive force of devastating power.

Initiation refers to the birth of the [[No-God]]. Exactly what the Consult did to create or unleash such an entity is unknown, save that the No-God's very presence on [[the World]] was anathema to life. The [[Years of the Crib]] began and the Apocalypse got underway in earnest. The carnage was not halted until [[Anaxophus V]] deployed the [[Heron Spear]] against the No-God at the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]] thirteen years later.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Apocalypse'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">The '''Inoculation''' was a medical treatment given to the [[Nonmen]] by the [[Inchoroi]], granting them immortality. The term is also sometimes used to refer to the period exceeding one hundred years when the Nonmen and Inchoroi were at peace. This period abruptly and violently ended in the [[Womb Plague]].

==Prelude==
Following [[Arkfall]], the [[Mansion]] of [[Viri]] was nearly destroyed. King [[Nin’janjin]] begged King [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] of [[Siöl]] for aid. Instead, Siöl invaded and occupied Viri. The Inchoroi won the allegiance of Nin'janjin by promising him vengeance against Cû’jara-Cinmoi. The Inchoroi and Nonmen of Viri marched to war together at the [[Battle of Pir Pahal]], but many of Nin'janjin's followers turned against the Inchoroi, horrified at their appearance and carnal nature. Only the arrival of Cû’jara-Cinmoi and his host saved the Nonmen of Viri from destruction. The Inchoroi were defeated, their King, [[Sil]], slain and their greatest weapon, the [[Heron Spear]], lost. [[Aurang]] rallied the Inchoroi and led them, and Nin'janjin, from the field.

The Inchoroi were forced to endure a long period - certainly decades and possibly more than a century - of siege within the Ark, under the vigilant eye of the [[Second Watch]]. Eventually they sent Nin'janjin to treat with Cû’jara-Cinmoi. To the latter's astonishment, Nin'janjin had not aged a day since Pir Pahal. Nin'janjin related that the Inchoroi were dwelling in horror and fear within the Ark and wished to sue for peace. He asked Cû’jara-Cinmoi what they might do to make amends. Cû’jara-Cinmoi replied that he would have death banished from his race.

==The Inoculation==
Cû’jara-Cinmoi agreed to suspend his war against the Inchoroi in return for immortality, to the dismay of many of his counsellors. Unwilling to risk any of their lives before his own - or believing that he could only lead by example - Cû’jara-Cinmoi was the first of his race after Nin'janjin to be Inoculated, a painful process involving hollow pins being inserted into every tissue of his body and an age-killing nostrum to be poured through them. Sarpanur of the Inchoroi - the King-Healer and Killer-of-Hells, but in reality [[Aurang]] - carried out the process. Cû’jara-Cinmoi soon regained his vigour and athleticism, and soon other Nonmen followed him. His wife [[Hanalinqû]] was the first Nonmen woman to accept the treatment.

The Inoculation was a gradual process, but within a century every Nonman Mansion had gone through the treatment and every High King and leader of note save only [[Sin’niroiha]] had endured it.

The first problems did not emerge until those Nonmen women already advanced in years began to die. It may be that such deaths did not arouse suspicion, as the treatment's effectiveness was not immediate and its effectiveness on Nonmen of advanced age was doubtful. Only [[Morimhira]] of the aged Nonmen became truly immortal. It was only when Hanalinqû perished, despite the ministrations of her Inchoroi surgeons, that suspicions were aroused. Soon the [[Womb Plague]] spread through the Nonman race, killing every female of the species. Cû’jara-Cinmoi realised that the deaths were taking place in the same order the women had been Inoculated. He also received intelligence that the Inchoroi were evacuating [[Eärwa]] and falling back on the Ark.

Driven to utter fury by the betrayal, Cû’jara-Cinmoi forged an alliance between the High Mansions and led the greatest army in Nonman history to confront the Inchoroi at the [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]] and make them pay for their actions.

Thus began the disaster that would be the doom of the Nonmen, and the woe that would drive so many Ishroi mad for grief and loss. The “death of death” promised by Nin-janjin and Aurang became the death of birth (Nasamorgas) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Inoculation'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1996">The '''Golden Room''' or '''Golden Court''' is a chamber at the heart of the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. Its original purpose is unclear, but by the time of the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]] it seems to have served as the primary base of operations for the [[Inchoroi]] under first [[Sil]] and later [[Aurang]].

The Golden Room holds within it the object known as the [[Inverse Fire]], which is known to drive those who gaze into it insane or into the ranks of the enemy. Following the [[Battle of Isal’imial]] and the twenty-year cleansing of the Ark, [[Nil’giccas]] learned of the Room and the Fire from the captive [[Nin’janjin]]. He sent three envoys into the Room, two of whom promptly went insane. The surviving sane one - or so it appeared at the time - [[Cet’ingira]], urged that the other two be put to death immediately.

With the Ark apparently indestructible and the Room acting as a trap for anyone who entered, Nil'giccas chose to evacuate the Ark and raise the [[Barricades]] around it to prevent anyone else from being exposed to the Fire. This was successful for several millennia, until Cet'ingira breached the Ark, corrupted the [[Mangaecca]] and exposed its leaders to the Room. [[Shaeönanra]] was likewise taken to the Room and decided to join the Inchoroi cause, founding the [[Consult]]. The dangers of the Room and the Inverse Fire were known by reputation to [[Titirga]], Grandmaster of the [[Sohonc]], but it is unclear how well-known the danger was to others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, during the [[Apocalypse]], [[Seswatha]] and [[Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti]] did not pass through the Golden Room in their famed raid on the Ark. However, after his feigned death and subsequent capture, Nau-Cayûti was taken to the Golden Room, where a chain of prisoners had to first pass the Inverse Fire before being consumed by the Carapace, prior to the awakening of the [[No-God]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Ordeal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imogirion_campaign.jpg|thumb|400px|The approximate route of the Illisserû fleet.]]
The '''Battle of Imogirion''' was a major engagement during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]]. It took place during the five centuries that separated the [[Battle of Pir Minginnial]] and the [[Battle of Isal’imial]] and was notable for being the only major [[Cûnuroi]] military campaign undertaken by sea.

==Prelude==
Following the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pir Minginnial, the great alliance established by [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]] shattered. Each [[Nonman]] [[Mansion]] chose to defend its own [[Reach]], with High King [[Sin’niroiha]] of [[Nihrimsul]] and [[Ishoriöl]] unable to hold them together. Ishoriöl endured five long sieges, each lasting more than a decade at a time.

During this period the other Nonmen Mansions mainly took defensive action, but distant [[Illisserû]] - the most nautical of the Mansions -  realised that this would ultimately lead to defeat. Taking the initiative, Illisserû assembled a great host and fleet and sailed from the [[Meneanor|Meneanor Sea]], through the [[Straits of Bajeda]] and west into the [[Great Ocean]]. They turned north for thousands of miles along the coast until they reached the [[Leash]], the straits separating the [[Yimaleti Mountains]] from [[Injor-Niyas]]. Finally, the fleet landed on the shores of [[Agongorea]]. The army disembarked and struck for the [[Incû-Holoinas]].

==The Battle==
Relatively little is known of the battle, save it was one of those counted as taking place on the [[Inniür-Shigogli]], the plain before the Ark, so presumably the host of Illisserû made it that far. Illisserû was attempting to take the Inchoroi by surprise, possibly whilst they were still besieging Ishoriöl, but this seems to have failed. The Nonmen army was destroyed and put to rout. History records a "nocturnal slaughter" on Agongorea, suggesting that the survivors of the army were destroyed by night as they fled back to their ships.

There were only one hundred survivors of the battle. Only one of the Nonmen warriors present, Moryror, survived the tempests, storms and shipwrecks that consumed them to see Illisserû again. The rest of the martial force of Illisserû was utterly destroyed.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Imogirion convinced the remaining Nonman Mansions of the folly of each continuing to fight alone. Around the time of this battle, or possibly later, Ishoriöl finally broke the back of the Inchoroi besieging armies. By this time [[Nil’giccas]] had succeeded his father and, as a [[Tsonos|Son of Tsonos]] through his mother, was able to establish a new coalition, which finally threw back the Inchoroi in defeat at the epic Battle of Isal'imial, which finally saw the [[Incû-Holoinas]] itself boarded and sacked.

Illisserû endured, but the loss of almost its entire warrior caste left it relatively defenceless. During the [[Cûno-Halaroi Wars]] it fell to the invading armies of men relatively easily. The Mansion stood empty for nigh four millennia, until [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]] gifted it to the [[Swayal Compact]] as their headquarters, now named Orovelai.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Illisserû', 'Battle of Imogirion'&lt;/ref&gt;

Curunq fought as part of the Nonman coalition during the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]], although the level of its involvement given its vast distance from the [[Incû-Holoinas]] is unknown.

That's probably a good idea, actually. We don't have dates for the events but we can put them in some kind of rough order instead.</text>

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1647">The '''Barricades''' were a sorcerous barrier erected across the entrance to the [[Incû-Holoinas]] by [[Emilidis]] on the order of his High King, [[Nil’giccas]], thus concluding the [[Cûno-Inchoroi Wars]].

The Barricades are one of the [[Sublime Contrivances]] of Emilidis. Though easily the most significant of the Artisan’s [[Aporos]] defying works, the Barricades remain largely a mystery. The few extant descriptions that remain are apocryphal and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Barricades'&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barricades apparently wholly barred entry to or exit from the Ark for over two thousand years (and potentially far longer) until they were destroyed circa 1100 Year-of-the-Tusk. However, there are contradictory elements in this timeline. [[Cet’ingira]] allegedly returned the [[Heron Spear]] to the Ark in 750, which is clearly not possible if the Ark was still sealed (the records may be garbled and meant that he took it to [[Golgotterath]], the fortress-complex erected at the base of the Ark by the Inchoroi's servants). [[Aurax]] and [[Aurang]] were also said to be hiding in the Ark until they were released, but allegedly were active in [[the World]] over a millennia earlier when they gave the ''[[The Chronicle of the Tusk]]'' to the men of [[Eänna]]. These matters remain debatable.

What is known is that, after years and maybe decades of careful study of the obstruction, [[Shaeönanra]] and Cet’ingira joined their sorcery together to shatter the Barricades and render the Ark accessible once more.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The False Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known Contrivances==
The known Contrivances of the Artisan are as follows:

* The [[False Sun|Day Lantern]].
* The [[Barricades]].
* The [[Immaculate Rim]].
* The [[Amiolas]].

The Contrivances are noted for their way of twisting reality in a manner that defies explanation, even by the Artisan's peers.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Sublime Contrivances'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="717">The '''Immaculate Rim''' or '''Orimuril''' ("Scarp" to men) is one of the [[Sublime Contrivances]] of the Artisan [[Emilidis]], a fabled set of armour worn by the great [[Nonman]] hero [[Sûjara-nin]], the fabled Red Ghoul of [[Eärwa]].

The Rim is armour of the finest [[nimil]] which also twists reality around the wearer, inverting gravity itself. This can be used offensively (to throw enemies into the air or sideways) or defensively (to allow the wearer to run up walls as if they were the floor and evade attack).

The fate of Sûjara-nin's and his armour is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Sublime Contrivances'&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">The '''Amiolas''', known to men as the '''Embalming-Skull''' or '''Cauldron''', is one of the [[Sublime Contrivances]] of the Artisan, [[Emilidis]].

The Amiolas is a sorcerous, face-encasing helm allowing the wearer to understand [[Ihrimsû]], the [[Nonman]] tongue, and is widely regarded as one of the most powerful Emilidic artifacts. Despite the miracles of sorcery, translation had (and has) remained stubbornly impervious to arcane facilitation. The genius of Emilidis was primarily metaphysical: he grasped the continuity of meaning and souls, how a sorcerous understanding of Ihrimsû entailed a sorcerous unification of disparate souls. Inventing new forms of sorcery as he proceeded, Emilidis imbued his helm with the soul of [[Immiriccas Cinialrig]], the infamous Malcontent, an Injori [[Ishroi]] condemned to die by [[Cû’jara-Cinmoi]], and given the choice by [[Nil’giccas]] between risking the Hells or dwelling forever as an amputated, interpreting soul.

The Amiolas surfaces in human histories at several junctures, including protracted periods where Kings and Grandmasters refused to wear what the Umeri called the Embalming-Skull, and the Kûniüri, the Cauldron, fearing it to be a weapon (which it almost certainly became on occasion). According to [[Sohonc]] scholars, the Amiolas melted the contents of Immiriccas into the warmer waters of the wearer’s soul, creating a composite, a morass that would dry out for some, deepen for others. Ihrimsû would come effortlessly, only twisted in every respect about the hard fibre of the Malcontent, the architecture of his ancient old soul. Though no records exist of wearers admitting to what had to be a profound transformation of identity, Mandate scholars report that [[Seswatha]] forever regretted demanding it from Nil’giccas, even though the information it provided allowed him and Nau-Kayûti to steal the Heron Spear, and so save the World.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, ''Amiolas''&lt;/ref&gt;

Seswatha actually wore the Amiolas three times, each time deeply regretting experience but regarding it as necessary. [[Mandate]] and [[Swayal Compact|Swayal]] sorcerers hold the artifact in suspicion, recalling Seswatha's own ambivalence over its use.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiolas resides in [[Ishterebinth]]. During the [[Great Ordeal]], Prince [[Varalt Sorweel|Sorweel]] of [[Sakarpus]] was sent to Ishterebinth as an envoy of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]. To facilitate communication with the Nonmen, he was forced to don the Amiolas. Having been previously sceptical of Kellhus's mission, he learned of the truth of the existence of the [[Inchoroi]] and the [[No-God]] through the device and became convinced of Kellhus's righteousness as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Great Ordeal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1822">The '''Years of the Crib''' (2143-2155) are the twelve years during the [[First Apocalypse]] when no human child was born. The effect was felt across the entire continent of [[Eärwa]] and, it is theorised, the entire [[the World|World]].

Through means still not understood, the [[Consult]] triggered [[Initiation]], the birth of the [[No-God]], during the [[Second Investiture]] of the [[Incû-Holoinas]]. The creation of the No-God saw every unborn child on the continent stillborn and conception became impossible. One theory is that the No-God's very presence was anathema to life and, given it's goal was to seal shut the World against the [[Outside]], it may have acted as a barrier to the creation of new souls in the World. This made the No-God's goal of reducing the human population of the World considerably easier.

The Years of the Crib are similar to the [[Inoculation]], which similarly prevented the [[Nonmen]] from reproducing albeit through the far cruder means of exacting surgery and the murder of every single Nonman woman by medical means.

The Years of the Crib ended when King [[Anaxophus V]] of [[Kyraneas]] deployed the [[Heron Spear]] against the No-God at the [[Second Battle of Mengedda]], killing the entity. The No-God's death allowed souls to re-enter the World and be born once more.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary I and II, 'Apocalypse', 'Years of the Crib'&lt;/ref&gt;

One element that has been puzzled over by scholars ever since, particularly the [[Mandate]], is why the [[Consult]] risked the No-God in battle at all, when they could have sat back for a century (when they had already waited many tens of centuries to achieve their goals) and simply let the entire human race die of old age. No conclusive answers have been reached.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="813">The '''Ekkinû''' is a sorcerous arras or tapestry in the possession of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]]. It is usually displayed behind Kellhus’s bench in the [[Eleven-Pole Chamber]] while on campaign. A sorcerous artifact of unknown provenance or function, it was first reported in the possession of Kellhus in 4122 (thus earning a place among the Orthodox “Articles of Damnation”). Several theories regarding its origins and uses have circulated through various literate entrepots around the Three Seas, among them the suggestion that the undulating displays constitute some kind of language, but consensus considers them decorative merely.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Glossary II, 'Ekkinû'&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ekkinû accompanied Kellhus during the [[Great Ordeal]].

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="784">Hi, Anaxophus. Thanks a lot for your contributions so far. I just wanted to note a couple of things. If you're going to use page number in references it's better to also mention which copy of the book you have. For example,

&lt;i&gt;The Great Ordeal&lt;/i&gt;, Chapter 10, US HC p.273

Or another format that makes it clear because page numbers are different in each copy. Otherwise, just use the book name and chapter without page numbers.

Also, Werthead said that it's better to wait a month or so after the North American release (yesterday) before adding story spoilers from TUC to the wiki. Info that doesn't spoil the plot is fine, though.

Thanks again.

He appeared during the Battle of [[Golgotterath]] and slew many countless men thinking him to be an ally. Finally, he was hit by a Chorae and turned into a statue of salt, but his attack broke the defence lines of men, allowing the Sranc to push them back.

''The No-God'' will start several weeks after the events of ''[[The Unholy Consult]]'' and is expected to span at least two books, although Bakker has acknowledged it may expand to three volumes. No publication date is set for the first book, although Bakker has already begun work on it.

            <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1447">The '''Progenitors''' are the species which created the [[Inchoroi]], built the [[Incû-Holoinas]] and mastered the art of the [[Tekne]]. Their true name is unknown.

The progenitors are native to another planet elsewhere in the void. They achieved total technological and biological mastery and were close to grasping the [[Absolute]] before discovering - possibly through the creation of the [[Inverse Fire]] - that they were doomed to eternal damnation after death. They created the Incû-Holoinas to carry their genetically-engineered servitors, the Inchoroi, through the void to obliterate life on other worlds until this removed the threat of damnation. It is unknown why the progenitors themselves did not join the expedition.

The fate of the progenitors is unknown. By [[Cet’ingira]]'s reckoning, the Incû-Holoinas crashed on [[The World]] over eight thousand years ago and, according to [[Wutteät]], it travelled through the void to "countless" other worlds before that. It may be that after such a long time, maybe tens of thousands of years, the progenitors are extinct, or drove themselves insane through the knowledge of the Inverse Fire.

The Inchoroi themselves remember nothing of their origins; what scant information is known was extracted by Cet’ingira and the Dûnyain from the Ark over the course of many years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Unholy Consult]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point following the [[Holy War|First Holy War]], Proyas married Miramis. The two later had two children, [[Nersei Xinemus|Xinemus]] and [[Nersei Thaila (younger)|Thaila]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

After [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri|Fanayal]]'s army attacks [[Aöknyssus]], Miramis and her children are removed to [[Attrempus]] for their safety&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;.

Following [[Maithanet]]'s coup, Esmenet thinks of fleeing to Aöknyssus and considers that Miramis would at least give her sanctuary&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
After Proyas is denounced as a traitor and strung up to be slowly left to die, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] brings up Miramis, Xinemus and Thaila as lives that will be saved by his decision to set up Proyas as an agent of the [[Consult]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

When [[Fanayal ab Kascamandri|Fanayal]]'s army attacks [[Aöknyssus]], Xinemus and his mother and sister are removed to [[Attrempus]] for their safety&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
After Proyas is denounced as a traitor and strung up to be slowly left to die, [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] brings up Miramis, Xinemus and Thaila as lives that will be saved by his decision to set up Proyas as an agent of the [[Consult]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

Following his father's death, Xinemus is presumably now the King of Conriya.

== Story ==

=== ''The Darkness That Comes Before'' ===
Achamian remembers falling in love with Proyas' "legendary mother" over the years he spent as Proyas' tutor in [[Aöknyssus]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

Later on, he also mentions how Thaila was furious over her son's delight at the answer Achamian had given him after being asked about the [[God of Gods|God]] ("I've heard many ru­mours, but I've nev­er met the man.") and almost dismissed him&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Warrior-Prophet'' ===
Achamian thinks about how Proyas still looks much the same as he did as a boy, including his curly black hair, which his moth­er had "both cursed and adored"&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Thousandfold Thought'' ===
Achamian remembers ac­com­pa­ny­ing Proyas and his moth­er to her dowa­ger es­tates in [[Anplei]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;.

At [[Shimeh]], Proyas casts his [[Chorae]] against one of the [[Cishaurim]], and thinks about how it had been a gift from his mother on his seventh birthday&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The White-Luck Warrior'' ===
Proyas recalls how, as a child, one of his duties had been to bear his moth­er's train at pub­lic ceremonies&lt;ref&gt;''The White-Luck Warrior'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
Proyas remembers how his mother would sometimes weep over the dangerous things he used to do as a child, such as climbing trees to the peak&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
Proyas thinks about how he had inherited the face and eyes of his mother, "just as the po­ets said"&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ilimenni and his triunaries (one of which was [[Thanteus Eskeles]]) formed the van of the five triunes sent into the Obmaw&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. However, unbeknownst to them, [[Skuthula]] guarded the Intrinsic Gate. The [[Wracu]] killed Ilimenni and most of his fellow Mandati, with only Eskeles managing to flee&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Story ==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
Before his son Proyas was born, Eukernas was bested by [[Hoga Gothyelk]] in the [[Battle of Maän]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;. From then on, he called his limp "Gothyelk's gift"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The last of [[House Nersei]]'s ancestral rivals, the [[House Nejata|Nejati]], were executed during his reign, which was the cause of an argument between Eukernas and Proyas&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;. Eukernas considered that the murder of these children was necessary to protect his sons and his people from a future war&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

When Eukernas' older son and heir Tirummas died at sea in 4100, his younger son Proyas became Crown Prince&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary, 'Tirummas, Nersei'&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Darkness That Comes Before'' ===
When talking to [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Kellhus]] about Hoga Gothyelk, Proyas mentions the Battle of Maän and his father's injury&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== ''The Warrior-Prophet'' ===
Proyas thinks to himself that [[Cnaiür urs Skiötha|Cnaiür]] is not that much younger than his father&lt;ref&gt;''The Warrior-Prophet'', Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Thousandfold Thought'' ===
Proyas writes a letter to his father retelling the encounter between Kellhus and a mysterious blind beggar in Gim&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''Life in the New Empire'' ===
Eukernas died at some point after the conquest of [[Shimeh]] and the beginning of the [[Great Ordeal]], with Proyas succeeding him as King of Conriya. On his deathbed, he called for his son, knowing (and maybe even hoping) he would not come&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== The Unholy Consult ===
Faced with his own impending death, Proyas thinks of his father, and comes to the conclusion that he was right all along in his decision to have the Nejati killed, and in his belief that "power is damnation"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. He also recalls how Eukernas had called for him on his deathbed&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

== Trivia ==
This character is named for the first time in ''The Thousandfold Thought'', where his name is given as "Eukernas II"&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in ''The Unholy Consult'', he is referred to as "Onoyas"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;. It's unknown which of the two is his actual canon name.

== Appearance ==
According to [[Serwë]], Eppaltros was a beautiful man&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''The Darkness That Comes Before'', Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Story ==

=== ''What Came Before'' ===
At some point during Serwë's years as a Gaunum concubine, Eppaltros stole into the dormitory and made love to [[Aälsa]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. However, he was later denounced by someone unknown and put to death&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== ''The Darkness That Comes Before'' ===
Serwë remembers the incident leading to Eppaltros' death&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Story ==

=== What Came Before ===
At some point between the conquest of [[Shimeh]] and the beginning of the Great Ordeal's march, Ze was adopted by Soter. It's likely this adoption took place during the [[Unification Wars]]. He was the first known Jekki to be considered a [[caste|caste-noble]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== ''The White-Luck Warrior'' ===
Ze led the Jekki contigent of the army of the [[Ketyai]] of the East&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== ''The Great Ordeal'' ===
Under the influence of the Meat, Ze claimed that their [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus|Lord-and-Prophet]] had became their butcher&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
When [[Nersei Proyas]] addressed the Ordealmen, telling them their Holy Aspect-Emperor had charged him with leading the final march to [[Golgotterath]], Ze franctically interrupted him&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''The Unholy Consult'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;. He then declared that the [[Scald]] had consumed their Aspect-Emperor, and that his own men had witnessed this&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. To avoid further chaos among the Great Ordeal, [[Anasûrimbor Kayûtas]] quickly intervened, killing Ze&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Story ==

=== What Came Before ===
Cu'cûlol joined the Consult at an unknown date.

=== ''The Unholy Consult'' ===
Cu'cûlol was among the Qûya who fought the [[Swayal Compact|Swayali]], [[Mandate|Mandati]] and [[Mysunsai]] under [[Anasûrimbor Serwa]] during the battle for [[Golgotterath]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. He was one of the casualties of this confrontation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Trivia ==
Cu'cûlol is referred to as "impossibly ancient"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, meaning he could quite possibly have been the second oldest living Nonman (after [[Morimhira]]) before his death in 4132.

== Skills ==
She was renowned as "one of the most gifted of the [[Qûya|Quyil]]"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Ishterebinth'&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Story ==
Tsinirû is known to have married Sin'niroiha after he was given the [[Day Lantern]] by [[Emilidis]] (it is not known if the marriage was a direct or more indirect result of this event)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This marriage allowed all the [[Mansions]] to finally be united under the Blood of [[Tsonos]] (as Sin'niroiha was not of this lineage)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Encyclopedic Glossary II, 'Sin'niroiha'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nil'giccas was the only known child of Sin'niroiha and Tsinirû&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Nothing is known of Tsinirû's life after the birth of her son, though it is possible she perished as a result of the [[Womb-Plague]].

== Trivia ==
* Tsinirû is the only known female Qûya.
* She is also one of only two female monarchs reigning in their own right to be mentioned in the series (the other being the [[Ûmeri Empire|Ûmeri]] Empress [[Avalunsil]]).

[[Sristai Ingiaban|Ingiaban]] was heard wondering whether the siege-tower would be tall enough "to give Shimeh's towers a kiss." [[Shressa Gaidekki|Gaidekki]] replied that "she need only stand on her tippytoes."&lt;ref&gt;''The Thousandfold Thought'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

While Sister was brought down, along with Count-Palatine Gaidekki, before reaching her destination, Tippytoes reached the walls allowing [[Nersei Proyas|Neresi Proyas]] and his [[Conriyan|kinsmen]] to storm the battlements.</text>

'''Eleva''' was a High Priestess of the [[Cult of Yatwer]] during the time of the early days of the [[Great Ordeal]].

She had been replaced by a [[Witch]] of the [[Swayal Compact]] sometime prior the convening of the [[Struck Table]] in the spring of 4132.  During this convention, the Witch masquerading as Eleva was uncovered and killed by [[Psatma Nannaferi]] through the use of her [[Chorae]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Judging Eye'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that the original Eleva was murdered to ensure the success of her Swayal replacement.

'''Anasûrimbor Koringhus''' was a [[Dûnyain]] Monk and son of [[Anasûrimbor Kellhus]].  He and his [[The Boy|son]] were the only survivors of the [[Consult]] destruction of [[Ishuäl]].&lt;br /&gt;

== Appearance ==
Anasûrimbor Koringhus has the appearance a Dûnyain [[Norsirai]] with light-coloured skin and blond hair, however he is horribly disfigured from years battling the Consult during the final days of Ishuäl.

His skin was heavily scarred, burned and damaged. He was missing one cheek, which left a hollow in his face that exposed gums and broken teeth.

Despite his horrible disfigurements, [[Drusas Achamian|Achamian]] was still able to see the physical traits of the [[Anasûrimbor Dynasty|Anasûrimbor]] line.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Ordeal'', Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Story ==

==== ''What Came Before'' ====
At some point before leaving Ishuäl, Anasûrimbor Kellhus was selected to be a Father.  Whether his son was born before he sent away is unknown.

Sometime between the events of ''[[The Warrior Prophet|The Warrior-Prophet]]''&lt;ref&gt;Assumption based on the Consult's interrogation of the Werigda at the end of The Warrior-Prophet, suggesting they still did not know of Ishuäl at this point.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Great Ordeal (Book)|The Great Ordeal]]'', the Consult finally discovered Ishuäl, the home of the Dûnyain.  After legions of [[Sranc]] assaulted the fortress from the [[Demua Mountains]] in the east, to no avail, [[Nonmen]] [[Qûya]] approached from [[Injor-Niyas]] to the west and decimated the exterior of the stronghold.  The Dûnyain, having been taught that sorcery is a lie, were completely unprepared.  Many simply awaited their death while others barricaded themselves in the [[Thousand Thousand Halls]] below.

The Dûnyain fought the Consult within the Labyrinth for years, with immense losses on both sides.  When the last of the Sranc finally succumbed, Koringhus and the Boy were the only two Dûnyain remaining.

&lt;br /&gt;

==== ''The Great Ordeal'' ====
Unbeknownst to Achamiam and [[Mimara]], Korinhgus spies them while they are still descending the glaciers towards Ishuäl.  When the pair discover the [[The Fathering|Fathering]] in the Upper Galleries of the Thousand Thousand Halls, Koringhus, still unknown to Achamian and Mimara, instructs The Boy to approach them alone before eventually making himself known.  He confronts them asking if his father has grasped the [[Absolute]].

Koringhus decides that he must find his father, and that travelling with Achamian and Mimara is the best way to accomplish this task.  He and the Boy travel with them as they head north along the Demua Mountains.  During their journey, Koringhus eventually asks Mimara to gaze upon him with her [[Judging Eye|sight]].  He then begins to realize that everything the Dûnyain believed was flawed, if not an outright lie.  He knows that he is mad and that the madness is getting worse.  Mimara eventually offers him [[Qirri]], which pushes his madness to the brink; he decides that the Shortest Path to the [[Absolute]] is by ending his life. He throws himself off a peak in the northern Demua Mountains, where he plummets to his death some thirty cubits below.
